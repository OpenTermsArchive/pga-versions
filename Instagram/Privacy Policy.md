Effective June 16, 2025 | [View printable version](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/) | [See previous versions](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/?show_versions=1)

We at Meta want you to understand what information we collect, and how we use and share it. That’s why we encourage you to read our Privacy Policy. This helps you use [Meta Products](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/?annotations[0]=0.ex.0-WhatProductsDoesThis) in the way that’s right for you.

In the Privacy Policy, we explain how we collect, use, share, retain and transfer information. We also let you know your rights. Each section of this Policy includes helpful examples and simpler language to make our practices easier to understand. We’ve also added links to resources where you can learn more about the privacy topics that interest you.

It's important to us that you know how to control your privacy, so we also show you where you can manage your information in the settings of the Meta Products you use. You can [update these settings](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/?link_dialog=PLATFORM_SETTINGS) to shape your experience.

What information do we collect?

The information we collect and process about you depends on how you use our [Products](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/?annotations[0]=0.ex.0-WhatProductsDoesThis). For example, we collect different information if you sell furniture on Marketplace than if you post a reel on Instagram. When you use our Products, we collect some information about you [even if you don't have an account](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/?annotations[0]=1.ex.41-InformationWeCollectIf).

Here's the information we collect:

[Your activity and information you provide](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/?subpage=1.subpage.1-YourActivityAndInformation)

* * *

[Friends, followers and other connections](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/?subpage=1.subpage.2-FriendsFollowersAndOther)

* * *

[App, browser and device information](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/?subpage=1.subpage.3-AppBrowserAndDevice)

* * *

[Information from partners, vendors and other third parties](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/?subpage=1.subpage.4-InformationFromPartnersVendors)

What if you don’t let us collect certain information?

Some information is required for our Products to work. Other information is optional, but without it, the quality of your experience might be affected.

[Learn more](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/?annotations[0]=1.ex.43-WhatHappensIfYou)

What if the information we collect doesn’t identify individuals?

In some cases information is de-identified, aggregated, or anonymized by third parties so that it no longer identifies individuals before it’s made available to us. We use this information as described below without trying to re-identify individuals.

How do we use your information?

We use [information we collect](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/?section_id=1-WhatInformationDoWe) to provide a personalized experience to you, including ads (if we show you ads on Meta Products), along with the other purposes we explain in detail below.

For some of these purposes, we use information [across Meta Company Products](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/?annotations[0]=2.ex.5-UsingInformationAcrossOur) from the accounts you choose to add to your Accounts Center, and [across your devices](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/?annotations[0]=2.ex.1-WhyWeUseInformation). The information we use for these purposes is automatically processed by our systems. But in some cases, we also use [manual review](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/?annotations[0]=2.ex.2-ManualReviewExamplesOf) to access and review your information.

To use less information that’s connected to individual users, in some cases we de-identify or aggregate information or anonymize it so that it no longer identifies you. We use this information in the same ways we use your information as described in this section.

Here are the ways we use your information:
