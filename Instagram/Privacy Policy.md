This includes websites and apps from partners that use our Business Tools.

Effective December 16, 2025 | [View printable version](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/version/25862970456621906/) | [See previous versions](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/version/25862970456621906/?show_versions=1)

We at Meta want you to understand what information we collect, and how we use and share it. That’s why we encourage you to read our Privacy Policy. This helps you use [Meta Products](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/?annotations[0]=0.ex.0-WhatProductsDoesThis) in the way that’s right for you.

In the Privacy Policy, we explain how we collect, use, share, retain and transfer information. We also let you know your rights. Each section of this Policy includes helpful examples and simpler language to make our practices easier to understand. We’ve also added links to resources where you can learn more about the privacy topics that interest you.

It's important to us that you know how to control your privacy, so we also show you where you can manage your information in the settings of the Meta Products you use. You can [update these settings](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/?link_dialog=PLATFORM_SETTINGS) to shape your experience.

What information do we collect?

The information we collect and process about you depends on how you use our [Products](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/?annotations[0]=0.ex.0-WhatProductsDoesThis). For example, we collect different information if you sell furniture on Marketplace than if you ask [AI at Meta](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/genai) to write a joke for you. When you use our Products, we collect some information about you [even if you don't have an account](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/?annotations[0]=1.ex.41-InformationWeCollectIf).

Here's the information we collect:

[Your activity and information you provide](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/?subpage=1.subpage.1-YourActivityAndInformation)

* * *

[Friends, followers and other connections](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/?subpage=1.subpage.2-FriendsFollowersAndOther)

* * *

[Information from partners, vendors and other third parties](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/?subpage=1.subpage.4-InformationFromPartnersVendors)

What if you don’t let us collect certain information?

Some information is required for our Products to work. Other information is optional, but without it, the quality of your experience might be affected.

[Learn more](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/?annotations[0]=1.ex.43-WhatHappensIfYou)

What if the information we collect doesn’t identify individuals?

In some cases information is de-identified, aggregated, or anonymized by third parties so that it no longer identifies individuals before it’s made available to us. We use this information as described below without trying to re-identify individuals.

How do we use your information?

We use [information we collect](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/?section_id=1-WhatInformationDoWe) to provide a personalized experience to you, including ads (if we show you ads), along with the other purposes we explain in detail below.

For some of these purposes, we use information [across Meta Company Products](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/?annotations[0]=2.ex.5-UsingInformationAcrossOur) from the accounts you choose to add to your Accounts Center, and [across your devices](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/?annotations[0]=2.ex.1-WhyWeUseInformation). The information we use for these purposes is automatically processed by our systems. But in some cases, we also use [manual review](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/?annotations[0]=2.ex.2-ManualReviewExamplesOf) to access and review your information.

To use less information that’s connected to individual users, in some cases we de-identify or aggregate information or anonymize it so that it no longer identifies you. We use this information in the same ways we use your information as described in this section.

Here are the ways we use your information:

Compliance with a legal obligation

The categories of information we use, why we process your information based on compliance with a legal obligation and how it’s processed are set out below:

Processing information when required by law

* * *

Why and how we process your information:

For processing information when the law requires it: Where we are under an obligation to disclose information such as, for example, if we receive a valid legal request for certain information (such as an Irish search warrant), we will access, preserve and / or share your information with regulators, law enforcement or others.

The way in which the information will be processed depends on the specific circumstances, see [How do we respond to legal requests, prevent harm and promote safety and integrity?](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/?section_id=10-HowDoWeRespond) for more. [Information for Law Enforcement Authorities](https://www.facebook.com/safety/groups/law/guidelines) provides information on the operational guidelines law enforcement needs to follow.

Examples of Irish and EU laws enforceable in Ireland that could give rise to an obligation requiring us to process the information we hold about you are:

*   Civil and commercial matters: where we are in receipt of a court order or otherwise required to disclose information for the purposes of court proceedings, such as under Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters.
*   Criminal matters: to comply with requests from Irish law enforcement to provide information in relation to an investigation, such as under Section 10 of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997 as amended by 6(1)(a) of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, or to take steps to report information to law enforcement where required.
*   Consumer matters: to comply with our obligations under consumer law such as the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014.
*   Corporate and taxation matters: to comply with our obligations such as the Companies Act 2014.
*   Regulatory matters: to comply with our obligations to engage with regulators, such as the Data Protection Commission under the General Data Protection Regulation and the Data Protection Act 2018.
*   Financial matters: to comply with our obligations under applicable financial services law such as the European Union (Payment Services) Regulations 2018
*   Access matters: to provide data to public sector bodies, the EU Commission, EU Central Bank or other EU bodies upon request from them, to provide data to you or your requested third party when requested by you, for example under EU Regulation 2023/2854 (Data Act)

View the [current list of laws](https://www.facebook.com/help/264930705713965) which are enforceable in Ireland that give rise to a legal obligation for Meta which results in the processing of information. New laws may be enacted or other obligations may become binding on our processing of your information which may require us to process your information and we will update this list from time to time.
