Introduction to the Advertising Standards
=========================================

1\. Overview

Understanding our Advertising Standards

Our Advertising Standards provide policy detail and guidance on the types of ad content we allow, and the types of ad content we prohibit. When advertisers place an order, each ad is reviewed against our policies. Our Advertising Standards also provide guidance on advertiser behavior that may result in advertising restrictions being placed on a Business Account or its assets (an ad account, Page or user account).

If you think your ad was mistakenly rejected, or if you think your Business Account or its assets were mistakenly restricted, you can request a review of either decision in .

2\. Meta advertising policy principles

Advertisers contribute to the Meta community in many ways, including highlighting new products and services or drawing attention to events and issues. To help keep both businesses and organizations who use our ad tools safe, and create a welcoming environment for everyone who uses our products and services, we have put in place our Advertising Standards to guide what is allowed across Meta technologies.

Advertisers running ads across Meta technologies must follow our and our Advertising Standards.

Our advertising policy principles

Our policies are guided by our company’s core and the following principles:

Enforcement of our policies

We use automated and, in some instances, manual review to enforce our policies. Beyond reviewing individual ads, we also monitor and investigate advertiser behavior, and may restrict advertiser accounts that don't follow our Advertising Standards, Community Standards or other Meta policies and terms. Our review process may not detect all policy violations, and ads remain subject to review and re-review and may be rejected for violating our policies at any time. It is an advertiser’s responsibility to understand and comply with our policies outlined in Meta’s Advertising Standards, our Terms of Service and any other applicable terms and guidelines, in addition to all local laws, regulations and, where applicable, . Advertisers whose ads are rejected will typically be provided an opportunity to edit their ads in order to bring them into compliance and can request another review if they believe their ad was incorrectly rejected.

People can report ads if they believe they violate our policies. They can also see the details on why a certain ad appeared in their Feed, and they can control the ads they see in their Feed through our Ad Preferences tool.

3\. The ad review process

Our ad review system relies primarily on automated tools to check ads and business assets against our policies. Our ad review process starts automatically before ads begin running, and is typically completed within 24 hours, although it may take longer in some cases. During this review, the status of the ad will be “In review.” Additionally, ads may be reviewed again, including after they are live. You can find more information in our

What is reviewed

The ad review system reviews ads for violations of our policies. This review process may include the specific components of an ad, such as images, video, text and targeting information, as well as an ad’s associated landing page or other destinations, among other information.

Business asset review

We also review and take action on an advertiser’s Business Account or its assets (ad accounts, Pages and user accounts). As part of our review, we assess whether the account or its assets have violated our policies.

Outcome of review

If a violation is found at any point in the review process, the ad will be rejected, and the Business Account or its assets may be restricted. Lower quality ads which do not necessarily violate our policies may experience impacted performance. You can find more information about how quality may affect your ad in our

If a Business Account or its assets (ad account, Page or user account) is restricted, that account or asset can’t be used to advertise across our technologies. If a user account is restricted from advertising on a Business Account or ad account, other members of those accounts may still be able to advertise.

Re-review of ads

Ads remain subject to review and re-review at all times, and may be rejected or restricted for violation of our policies at any time. It is your responsibility to understand and comply with our policies.

Your use of Meta’s advertising products and services is part of “Meta” under Meta’s Statement of Rights and Responsibilities (, the “SRR”) and is subject to the SRR. You may be subject to additional terms or guidelines if you use Instagram or certain Meta advertising-related products or services.
    
2.  Advertisers are responsible for understanding and complying with all applicable laws and regulations. Failure to comply may result in a variety of consequences, including the cancellation of ads you have placed and termination of your account.
    
3.  We do not use sensitive personal data for ad targeting. Topics you choose for targeting your ad don't reflect the personal beliefs, characteristics or values of the people who use Facebook or Instagram.
    
4.  Once displayed, ads are public information. Ads may be re-shared and accessed outside of the targeted audience, including from the Facebook Page running the ads or within Meta Products.

Transparency requirements under the EU Digital Services Act

Meta is required by EU law to ensure that its users located in the EU, and associated territories, are able to identify certain information about each ad that they see, including information about the natural or legal person on whose behalf the advertisement is presented and the natural or legal person who is paying for the ad (if different).

In order for Meta to be able to meet its obligations, when creating an ad, you are required to provide the following information in the associated text fields:

*   : the full legal name of the person, company, business, charity or institution on whose behalf your ad is being presented.
    
*   : the full legal name of the person, company, business, charity or institution who paid for the ad.
    

You are responsible for ensuring that this information is complete, accurate and up-to-date for each ad that you submit to Meta, and that it remains so for the entirety of the period during which the ad is running.
