What are cookies, and what does this policy cover?
==================================================

Effective December 12, 2023

Cookies are small pieces of text used to store information on web browsers. Cookies are used to store and receive identifiers and other information on computers, phones and other devices. Other technologies, including data that we store on your web browser or device, identifiers associated with your device and other software, are used for similar purposes. In this policy, we refer to all of these technologies as “cookies”.

We use cookies if you have a Facebook or Instagram account, use the Meta Products, including our website and apps, or visit other websites and apps that use the Meta Products (including the Like button). Cookies enable Meta to offer the Meta Products to you and to understand the information that we receive about you, including information about your use of other websites and apps, whether or not you are registered or logged in.

This policy explains how we use cookies and the choices you have. Except as otherwise stated in this policy, the Privacy Policy will apply to our processing of the data that we collect via cookies.

Why do we use cookies?
======================

Cookies help us provide, protect and improve the Meta Products, such as by personalising content, tailoring and measuring ads, and providing a safer experience. The cookies that we use include session cookies, which are deleted when you close your browser, and persistent cookies, which stay in your browser until they expire or you delete them. The cookies we use and how we use them\[1\] may change over time as we improve and update Meta Products, we typically use them for the following purposes:

Authentication
--------------

We use cookies to verify your account and determine when you’re logged in so that we can make it easier for you to access the Meta Products and show you the appropriate experience and features.

* For example: We use cookies to keep you logged in as you navigate between Facebook Pages. Cookies also help us remember your browser so you don't have to keep logging in to Facebook and so you can more easily log in to Facebook via third-party apps and websites. For example, we use the "c\_user" and "xs" cookies, including for this purpose, which have a lifespan of 365 days.

Security, site and product integrity
------------------------------------

We use cookies to help us keep your account, data and the Meta Products safe and secure.

* For example: Cookies can help us identify and impose additional security measures when someone may be attempting to access a Facebook account without authorisation, for instance, by rapidly guessing different passwords. We also use cookies to store information that allows us to recover your account in the event that you forget your password or to require additional authentication if you tell us that your account has been hacked. This includes, for example, our "sb" and "dbln" cookies, which enable us to identify your browser securely, as well as “datr." "Datr" is a unique identifier for your browser that, amongst other things, helps us protect you from fraud. For example, it helps us identify trusted browsers where you have logged in before. “Datr” has a lifespan of 400 days.

We also use cookies to combat activity that violates our policies or otherwise degrades our ability to provide the Meta Products.

* For example: Cookies help us fight spam and phishing attacks by enabling us to identify computers that are used to create large numbers of fake Facebook accounts. We also use cookies to detect computers infected with malware and to take steps to prevent them from causing further harm. Our "csrf" cookie, for example, helps us prevent cross-site request forgery attacks. The “datr” cookie also helps us to identify the browsers used by malicious actors and to prevent cyber-security attacks, such as a denial of service attack that could prevent you from accessing the Meta Products. Cookies also help us prevent underage people from registering for Facebook accounts.

Advertising, recommendations, insights and measurement
------------------------------------------------------

We use cookies to help us show ads and to make recommendations for businesses and other organisations to people who may be interested in the products, services or causes they promote.

* For example: Cookies allow us to help deliver ads to people who have previously visited a business’s website, purchased its products or used its apps and to recommend products and services based on that activity. Cookies also allow us to limit the number of times that you see an ad so you don’t see the same ad over and over again. For example, the "fr" cookie is used to deliver, measure and improve the relevancy of ads, with a lifespan of 90 days.

We also use cookies to help measure the performance of ad campaigns for businesses that use the Meta Products.

* For example: We use cookies to count the number of times that an ad is shown and to calculate the cost of those ads. We also use cookies to measure how often people do things, such as make a purchase following an ad impression. For example, the "\_fbp" cookie identifies browsers for the purposes of providing advertising and site analytics services and has a lifespan of 90 days.

Cookies help us serve and measure ads across different browsers and devices used by the same person.

* For example: We can use cookies to prevent you from seeing the same ad over and over again across the different devices that you use.

Cookies also allow us to provide insights about the people who use the Meta Products, as well as the people who interact with the ads, websites and apps of our advertisers and the businesses that use the Meta Products.

* For example: We use cookies to help businesses understand the kinds of people who like their Facebook Page or use their apps so that they can provide more relevant content and develop features that are likely to be interesting to their customers.

We also use cookies, such as our "oo" cookie, which has a lifespan of 400 days, to help you opt out of seeing ads from Meta based on your activity on third-party websites. Learn more about the information we receive, how we decide which ads to show you on and off the Meta Products and the controls that are available to you.

Site features and services
--------------------------

We use cookies to enable the functionality that helps us provide the Meta Products.

* For example: Cookies help us store preferences, know when you’ve seen or interacted with Meta Products’ content and provide you with customised content and experiences. For instance, cookies allow us to make suggestions to you and others, and to customise content on third-party sites that integrate our social plugins. If you are a Facebook Page administrator, cookies allow you to switch between posting from your personal Facebook account and the Facebook Page. We use cookies such as the session-based "presence" cookie to support your use of Messenger chat windows.

We also use cookies to help provide you with content relevant to your locale.

* For example: We store information in a cookie that is placed on your browser or device so that you will see the site in your preferred language.

Performance
-----------

We use cookies to provide you with the best experience possible.

* For example: Cookies help us route traffic between servers and understand how quickly Meta Products load for different people. Cookies also help us record the ratio and dimensions of your screen and windows and know whether you’ve enabled high-contrast mode, so that we can render our sites and apps correctly. For example, we set the "dpr" and "wd" cookies, each with a lifespan of 7 days, for purposes including to deliver an optimal experience for your device’s screen.

Analytics and research
----------------------

We use cookies to better understand how people use the Meta Products so that we can improve them.

* For example: Cookies can help us understand how people use the Facebook service, analyse which parts of our Products people find most useful and engaging, and identify features that could be improved.

Third-party websites and apps
-----------------------------

Our business partners may also choose to share information with Meta from cookies set in their own websites' domains, whether or not you have a Facebook or Instagram account or are logged in. Specifically, cookies named \_fbc or \_fbp may be set on the domain of the business partner whose site you're visiting. Unlike cookies that are set on Meta's own domains, these cookies aren’t accessible by Meta when you're on a site other than the one on which they were set, including when you are on one of our domains. They serve the same purposes as cookies set in Meta's own domain, which are to personalise content (including ads), measure ads, produce analytics and provide a safer experience, as set out in this Cookies Policy.
