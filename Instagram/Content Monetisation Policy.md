Instagram Content Monetization Policies
=======================================

We offer features and products that help creators and publishers earn money from their content. This content has to follow certain rules.

All content on Instagram must comply with our Terms of Use and Community Standards. These are our high-level rules against sexual, violent, profane or hateful content. However, content appropriate for Instagram in general is not necessarily appropriate for monetization.

Creators and publishers need to adhere to our Partner Monetization Policies and Content Monetization Policies in order to make money from their content. Your content itself must follow these guidelines in order to be eligible for monetization.

If your video complies with our Content Monetization Policies, advertisers can prevent their ads from appearing in sensitive content. For examples of subjects that are sensitive to advertisers, please review our guidelines for Advertiser-Friendly Content.
