Instagram Content Monetization Policies
=======================================

We offer features and products that help creators and publishers earn money from their content. This content has to follow certain rules.

All content on Instagram must comply with our Terms of Use and Community Standards. These are our high-level rules against sexual, violent, profane or hateful content. However, content appropriate for Instagram in general is not necessarily appropriate for monetization.

Creators and publishers need to adhere to our Partner Monetization Policies and Content Monetization Policies in order to make money from their content. Your content itself must follow these guidelines in order to be eligible for monetization.

If your video complies with our Content Monetization Policies, advertisers can prevent their ads from appearing in sensitive content. For examples of subjects that are sensitive to advertisers, please review our guidelines for Advertiser-Friendly Content.

Prohibited formats
------------------

Content presented in the following formats cannot be monetized:

Content posted for the sole purpose of increasing engagement by asking people to react to questions posed by the content.

Content that primarily displays static images played in succession.

**Looping videos**

Content that loops and displays the same segment multiple times. Looping content can include GIFs and content of varying lengths.

Instagram Partner Monetization Policies
=======================================

Eligibility Standards for Promotional Tools are now called Instagram Partner Monetization Policies. This is still the best place to learn about the rules for using Instagram's monetization tools.

In order for creators and publishers to use Monetization or Promotional tools on Instagram from Meta (including Shopping from Creators), they must comply with a set of rules called Instagram Partner Monetization Policies. These rules apply to accounts, behaviors and payments. There is a separate set of policies, called Instagram Content Monetization Policies, that apply specifically to monetized content.

Partner Policies
----------------

In order to use Monetization or Promotional tools on Instagram from Meta, your account and content must:

**Reside in an Eligible Country**

To monetize, you must reside in an eligible country where the product or feature is available. You may lose your ability to monetize if you move to an ineligible location or if Instagram from Meta changes product eligibility.

**Follow our Community Standards**

These rules apply to all posts and interactions on Instagram from Meta, including rules against hateful conduct, calls for violence, and sexualized content. Any content posted by publishers or creators that violates our Community Standards, including our policies regarding intellectual property, authenticity, and user safety, may cause publishers or creators to become ineligible or lose their eligibility to monetize using our features. If you believe you may have violated our policies regarding intellectual property, you can find more information, learn more about copyright or trademark infringement.

**Follow our Content Monetization Policies**

Monetized content must pass an additional level of standards above and beyond our Community Standards. These rules are called Instagram Content Monetization Policies. These include deeper restrictions on the content itself and the formats in which it is presented. Creators and publishers must ensure that their profiles, including their profile pictures and profile descriptions as well as their content, follow our Content Monetization Policies.

**Share accurate information**

Creators and publishers posting content flagged as misinformation and false news may be ineligible or may lose their eligibility to monetize. You can read more about this here.

**Monetize authentic engagement**

Creators and publishers can only monetize content consumed by their natural, authentic audience. This means creators and publishers may not engage in any behavior that artificially boosts or amplifies followers, views or engagement for the purpose of generating more revenue. This includes manufactured sharing, which is coordinated distribution of content, often for compensation.

Creators and publishers may lose the ability to monetize if their audience significantly consists of fake engagement, including, but not limited to, likes, follows, and views.

**Follow our Payment Terms**

Monetizing Creators and publishers must comply with Instagram from Meta's rules for making and receiving payments.

**Develop an established presence**

Creators and publishers must have an authentic, established presence on Instagram from Meta. This also includes maintaining a sufficient follower base.

**Follow our rules for politicians and governments**

The following political and government entities are ineligible for monetization:

*   Current elected and appointed government officials
    
*   Current political candidates
    
*   Political parties
    
*   Registered political committees
    
*   Government agencies and departments
    

Communications that are regulated as political advertising under applicable law are also ineligible for monetization features.

**Avoid systemic violations**

Monetized creators and publishers, and those that have not been onboarded to a monetization product, may lose the ability to monetize if an entity connected to it has repeatedly violated these policies.

**Instagram from Meta reserves the right to modify, suspend or terminate access to, or discontinue the availability of, its content monetization features at any time.**
