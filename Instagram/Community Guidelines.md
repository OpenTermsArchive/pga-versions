_**COVID-19: Community Guidelines Updates and Protections:** As people around the world confront this unprecedented public health emergency, we want to make sure that our Community Guidelines protect people from harmful content and new types of abuse related to COVID-19. We’re working to remove content that has the potential to contribute to real-world harm, including through our policies prohibiting coordination of harm, sale of medical masks and related goods, hate speech, bullying and harassment and misinformation that contributes to the risk of imminent violence or physical harm. To learn more about our policies on COVID-19 and vaccines, [see here.](https://help.instagram.com/697825587576762)_

The Short

We want Instagram to continue to be an authentic and safe place for inspiration and expression. Help us foster this community. Post only your own photos and videos and always follow the law. Respect everyone on Instagram, don’t spam people or post nudity.

The Long

Instagram is a reflection of our diverse community of cultures, ages, and beliefs. We’ve spent a lot of time thinking about the different points of view that create a safe and open environment for everyone.

We created the Community Guidelines so you can help us foster and protect this amazing community. By using Instagram, you agree to these guidelines and our [Terms of Use](https://www.instagram.com/legal/terms). We’re committed to these guidelines and we hope you are too. Overstepping these boundaries may result in deleted content, [disabled accounts](https://help.instagram.com/366993040048856?helpref=faq_content), or other restrictions.

In some cases, we allow content for public awareness which would otherwise go against our Community Guidelines – if it is newsworthy and in the public interest. We do this only after weighing the public interest value against the risk of harm and we look to international human rights standards to make these judgments.

* **Share only photos and videos that you’ve taken or have the right to share.**
    
    As always, you own the content you post on Instagram. Remember to post authentic content, and don’t post anything you’ve copied or collected from the Internet that you don’t have the right to post. Learn more about [intellectual property rights](https://help.instagram.com/126382350847838?helpref=faq_content).
    
* **Post photos and videos that are appropriate for a diverse audience.**
    
    We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don’t allow [nudity](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.instagram.com%2F%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcommunitystandards%2Fadult_nudity_sexual_activity) on Instagram. This includes photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos in the context of breastfeeding, birth giving and after-birth moments, health-related situations (for example, post-mastectomy, breast cancer awareness or gender confirmation surgery) or an act of protest are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings and sculptures is OK, too.
    
    People like to share photos or videos of their children. For safety reasons, there are times when we may remove images that show [nude or partially-nude children](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.instagram.com%2F%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcommunitystandards%2Fchild_nudity_sexual_exploitation). Even when this content is shared with good intentions, it could be used by others in unanticipated ways. You can learn more on our [Tips for Parents page](https://help.instagram.com/154475974694511/?helpref=faq_content).
    
* **Foster meaningful and genuine interactions.**
    
    Help us stay [spam-free](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.instagram.com%2F%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcommunitystandards%2Fspam) by not artificially collecting likes, followers, or shares, posting repetitive comments or content, or repeatedly contacting people for commercial purposes without their consent. Don’t offer money or giveaways of money in exchange for likes, followers, comments or other engagement. Don’t post content that engages in, promotes, encourages, facilitates, or admits to the offering, solicitation or trade of [fake and misleading user reviews or ratings](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.instagram.com%2F%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcommunitystandards%2Ffraud_deception).
    
    You don’t have to use your real name on Instagram, but we do require Instagram users to provide us with accurate and up to date information. Don't [impersonate](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.instagram.com%2F%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcommunitystandards%2Fmisrepresentation) others and don't create accounts for the purpose of violating our guidelines or [misleading others](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.instagram.com%2F%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.fb.com%2Fpolicies%2Fcommunity-standards%2Finauthentic-behavior%2F).
    
* **Follow the law.**
    
    Instagram is not a place to support or praise [terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.instagram.com%2F%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcommunitystandards%2Fdangerous_individuals_organizations). Offering [sexual services](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.instagram.com%2F%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcommunitystandards%2Fsexual_solicitation), buying or selling firearms, alcohol, and tobacco products between private individuals, and buying or selling non-medical or pharmaceutical drugs are also not allowed. We also remove content that attempts to trade, co-ordinate the trade of, donate, gift, or ask for non-medical drugs, as well as content that either admits to personal use (unless in the recovery context) or coordinates or promotes the use of non-medical drugs. Instagram also prohibits the sale of live animals between private individuals, though brick-and-mortar stores may offer these sales. No one may coordinate poaching or selling of endangered species or their parts.
    
    Remember to always follow the law when offering to sell or buy other [regulated goods](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.instagram.com%2F%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcommunitystandards%2Fregulated_goods). Accounts promoting online gambling, online real money games of skill or online lotteries must get our prior written permission before using any of our products.
    
    We have zero tolerance when it comes to sharing [sexual content involving minors](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.instagram.com%2F%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcommunitystandards%2Fchild_nudity_sexual_exploitation) or threatening to post [intimate images](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.instagram.com%2F%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcommunitystandards%2Fsexual_exploitation_adults) of others.
    
* **Respect other members of the Instagram community.**
    
    We want to foster a positive, diverse community. We remove content that contains [credible threats](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.instagram.com%2F%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcommunitystandards%2Fcredible_violence) or [hate speech](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.instagram.com%2F%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcommunitystandards%2Fhate_speech), content that targets private individuals to [degrade or shame them](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.instagram.com%2F%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcommunitystandards%2Fbullying), personal information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large public audience due to their profession or chosen activities.
    
    It's never OK to encourage violence or attack anyone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disabilities, or diseases. When hate speech is being shared to challenge it or to raise awareness, we may allow it. In those instances, we ask that you express your intent clearly.
    
    [Serious threats of harm](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.instagram.com%2F%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcommunitystandards%2Fcredible_violence) to public and personal safety aren't allowed. This includes specific threats of physical harm as well as threats of theft, vandalism, and other financial harm. We carefully review reports of threats and consider many things when determining whether a threat is credible.
    
* **Maintain our supportive environment by not glorifying self-injury.**
    
    The Instagram community cares for each other, and is often a place where people facing difficult issues such as eating disorders, cutting, or other kinds of self-injury come together to create awareness or find support. We try to do our part by providing education in the app and adding information in the [Help Center](https://help.instagram.com/) so people can get the help they need.
    
    Encouraging or urging people to embrace [self-injury](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.instagram.com%2F%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcommunitystandards%2Fsuicide_self_injury_violence) is counter to this environment of support, and we’ll remove it or disable accounts if it’s reported to us. We may also remove content identifying victims or survivors of self-injury if the content targets them for attack or humor.
    
* **Be thoughtful when posting newsworthy events.**
    
    We understand that many people use Instagram to share important and newsworthy events. Some of these issues can involve graphic images. Because so many different people and age groups use Instagram, we may remove videos of intense, [graphic violence](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.instagram.com%2F%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcommunitystandards%2Fgraphic_violence) to make sure Instagram stays appropriate for everyone.
    
    We understand that people often share this kind of content to condemn, raise awareness or educate. If you do share content for these reasons, we encourage you to caption your photo with a warning about graphic violence. Sharing [graphic images for sadistic pleasure](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.instagram.com%2F%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcommunitystandards%2Fcruel_insensitive) or to glorify violence is never allowed.
    

Help us keep the community strong:

* Each of us is an important part of the Instagram community. If you see something that you think may violate our guidelines, please help us by using our [built-in reporting option](https://help.instagram.com/165828726894770?helpref=faq_content). We have a global team that reviews these reports and works as quickly as possible to remove content that doesn’t meet our guidelines. Even if you or someone you know doesn’t have an Instagram account, you can still [file a report](https://help.instagram.com/contact/383679321740945). When you complete the report, try to provide as much information as possible, such as links, usernames, and descriptions of the content, so we can find and review it quickly. We may remove entire posts if either the imagery or associated captions violate our guidelines.
* You may find content you don’t like, but doesn’t violate the Community Guidelines. If that happens, you can [unfollow](https://help.instagram.com/286340048138725?helpref=faq_content) or [block](https://help.instagram.com/426700567389543/?helpref=faq_content) the person who posted it. If there's something you don't like in a comment on one of your posts, you can [delete that comment](https://help.instagram.com/289098941190483?helpref=faq_content).
* Many disputes and misunderstandings can be resolved directly between members of the community. If one of your photos or videos was posted by someone else, you could try commenting on the post and asking the person to take it down. If that doesn’t work, you can [file a copyright report](https://help.instagram.com/126382350847838?helpref=faq_content). If you believe someone is violating your trademark, you can [file a trademark report](https://help.instagram.com/222826637847963?helpref=faq_content). Don't target the person who posted it by posting screenshots and drawing attention to the situation because that may be classified as harassment.
* We may work with law enforcement, including when we believe that there’s risk of physical harm or threat to public safety.

For more information, check out our [Help Center](https://help.instagram.com/) and [Terms of Use](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.instagram.com%2F%3Fu=http%3A%2F%2Finstagram.com%2Flegal%2Fterms%2F%23).

Thank you for helping us create one of the best communities in the world,

The Instagram Team

Adult Nudity and Sexual Activity
================================

#### Policy Rationale

We restrict the display of nudity or sexual activity because some people in our community may be sensitive to this type of content. Additionally, we default to removing sexual imagery to prevent the sharing of non-consensual or underage content. Restrictions on the display of sexual activity also apply to digitally created content unless it is posted for educational, humorous, or satirical purposes.

Our nudity policies have become more nuanced over time. We understand that nudity can be shared for a variety of reasons, including as a form of protest, to raise awareness about a cause, or for educational or medical reasons.

Where such intent is clear, we make allowances for the content. For example, while we restrict some images of female breasts that include the nipple, we allow other images, including those depicting acts of protest, women actively engaged in breast-feeding and photos of post-mastectomy scarring. For images depicting visible genitalia or the anus in the context of birth and after-birth moments or health-related situations we include a warning label so that people are aware that the content may be sensitive. We also allow photographs of paintings, sculptures, and other art that depicts nude figures.

#### Do not post:

* Imagery of real nude adults, if it depicts:
    * Visible genitalia except in the context of birth giving and after-birth moments or if there is medical or health context situations (for example, gender confirmation surgery, examination for cancer or disease prevention/assessment).
    * Visible anus and/or fully nude close-ups of buttocks unless photoshopped on a public figure.
    * Uncovered female nipples except in the context of breastfeeding, birth giving and after-birth moments, medical or health context (for example, post-mastectomy, breast cancer awareness or gender confirmation surgery) or an act of protest.
* Imagery of sexual activity, including:
    * Explicit sexual activity and stimulation
        * Explicit sexual intercourse or oral sex, defined as mouth or genitals entering or in contact with another person's genitals or anus, where at least one person's genitals are nude.
        * Explicit stimulation of genitalia or anus, defined as stimulating genitalia or anus or inserting objects, including sex toys, into genitalia or anus, where the contact with the genitalia or anus is directly visible.
    * Implied sexual activity and stimulation, except in cases of medical or health context, advertisements, and recognized fictional images or with indicators of fiction:
        * Implied sexual intercourse or oral sex, defined as mouth or genitals entering or in contact with another person's genitals or anus, when the genitalia and/or the activity or contact is not directly visible.
        * Implied stimulation of genitalia or anus, defined as stimulating genitalia or anus or inserting objects, including sex toys, into or above genitalia or anus, when the genitalia and/or the activity or contact is not directly visible.
    * Other activities, except in cases of medical or health context, advertisements, and recognized fictional images or with indicators of fiction, including but not limited to:

        * Stimulation of naked human nipples.
        * Squeezing female breasts, defined as a grabbing motion with curved fingers that shows both marks and clear shape change of the breasts. We allow squeezing in breastfeeding contexts.

        * Dismemberment.
        * Cannibalism.
        * Feces, urine, spit, snot, menstruation or vomit.
        * Bestiality.
    * Adult sexual activity in digital art, except when posted in an educational or scientific context, or when it meets one of the criteria below and shown only to individuals 18 years and older.
* Extended audio of sexual activity

#### For the following content, we include a label so that people are aware the content may be sensitive:

Imagery of visible adult male and female genitalia, fully nude close-ups of buttocks or anus, or implied/other sexual activity, when shared in medical or health context which can include, for example:

* Birth-giving and after-birth giving moments, including both natural vaginal delivery and caesarean section
* Gender confirmation surgery
* Genitalia self-examination for cancer or disease prevention/assessment

#### We only show this content to individuals 18 and older:

* Real world art that depicts implied or explicit sexual activity.
* Imagery depicting bestiality in real-world art provided it is shared neutrally or in condemnation and the people or animals depicted are not real.
* Implied adult sexual activity in advertisements, recognized fictional images or with indicators of fiction.

    * The sexual activity (intercourse or other sexual activities) isn’t explicit and not part of the above specified fetish content.
    * The content was posted in a satirical or humorous context.
    * Only body shapes or contours are visible.

Child Sexual Exploitation, Abuse, and Nudity
============================================

#### Policy Rationale

We do not allow content or activity that sexually exploits or endangers children. When we become aware of apparent child exploitation, we report it to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), in compliance with applicable law. We know that sometimes people share nude images of their own children with good intentions; however, we generally remove these images because of the potential for abuse by others and to help avoid the possibility of other people reusing or misappropriating the images.

We also work with external experts, including the [Facebook Safety Advisory Board](https://www.facebook.com/help/222332597793306?ref=ccs), to discuss and improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, especially with regard to children. Learn more about the [technology we’re using to fight against child exploitation](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/10/fighting-child-exploitation/).

#### Do not post:

We may remove content that identifies alleged victims of child sexual exploitation through means other than name or image if content includes information that is likely to lead to the identification of the individual.

We may remove content created for the purpose of identifying a private minor if there is a risk to the minor’s safety, when requested by Law Enforcement, Government, Trusted Partner, or the content is self-reported by the minor or the minor’s parent/legal guardian

Spam
====

#### Policy Rationale

We work hard to limit the spread of spam because we do not want to allow content that is designed to deceive, or that attempts to mislead users, to increase viewership. This content creates a negative user experience, detracts from people's ability to engage authentically in online communities and can threaten the security, stability and usability of our services. We also aim to prevent people from abusing our platform, products or features to artificially increase viewership or distribute content en masse for commercial gain.

#### Do not:

* Post, share, engage with content or create accounts, Groups, Pages, Events or other assets, either manually or automatically, at very high frequencies.
* Attempt to or successfully sell, buy or exchange site privileges, engagement, or product features, such as accounts, admin roles, permission to post, Pages, Groups, likes, etc., except in the case of clearly identified branded content, as defined by our [Branded Content Policies](https://www.facebook.com/policies/brandedcontent/).

* Require or claim that users are required to engage with content (e.g. liking, sharing) before they are able to view or interact with promised content.
* Encourage likes, shares, follows, clicks or the use of apps or websites under false pretenses, such as:
    * Offering false or non-existent services or functionality(e.g. “Get a ‘Dislike’ button!”)
    * Failing to direct to promised content (e.g. “Click here for a discount code at Nordstrom”; _false play buttons_)
    * The deceptive or misleading use of URLs, defined as:
        * **Cloaking**: Presenting different content to Facebook users and Facebook crawlers or tools.
        * **Misleading content**: Content contains a link that promises one type of content but delivers something substantially different.
        * **Deceptive redirect behavior**: Websites that require an action (e.g. captcha, watch ad, click here) in order to view the expected landing page content and the domain name of the URL changes after the required action is complete.
        * **Like/share-gating**: Landing pages that require users to like, share, or otherwise engage with content before gaining access to content.
        * **Deceptive landing page functionality**: Websites that have a misleading user interface, which results in accidental traffic being generated (e.g. pop-ups/unders, clickjacking, etc.).
        * **Typosquatting**: An external website pretends to be a reputable brand or service by using a name, domain or content that features typos, misspellings or other means to impersonate well-known brands using a landing page similar to another, trusted site to mislead visitors (e.g. www.faceb00k.com, www.face\_book.com).
        * And other behaviors that are substantially similar to the above.

Account Integrity and Authentic Identity
========================================

#### Policy Rationale

Authenticity is the cornerstone of our community. We believe that authenticity helps create a community where people are accountable to each other, and to Facebook, in meaningful ways. We want to allow for the range of diverse ways that identity is expressed across our global community, while also preventing impersonation and identity misrepresentation. That is why we require people to create a Facebook account using the name they go by in everyday life. Our authenticity policies are intended to create a safe environment where people can trust and hold one another accountable.

In order to maintain a safe environment and empower free expression, we remove accounts that are harmful to the community, including those that compromise the security of other accounts and our services. We have built a combination of automated and manual systems to block and remove accounts that are used to persistently or egregiously abuse our Community Standards.

Because account level removal is a severe action, whenever possible, we aim to give our community a chance to learn our rules and follow our Community Standards. Penalties, including account disables, are designed to be proportionate to the severity of the violation and the risk of harm posed to the community. Continued violations, despite repeated warnings and restrictions, or violations that pose severe safety risks will lead to an account being disabled.

#### We do not allow the use of our services and will restrict or disable accounts or other entities (such as pages, groups, and events) if you:

* [Severely violate](https://transparency.fb.com/enforcement/taking-action/disabling-accounts/) our Community Standards.
* [Persistently violate](https://transparency.fb.com/enforcement/taking-action/disabling-accounts/) our Community Standards.
* Coordinate as part of a network of accounts or other entities in order to violate or evade our Community Standards.
* Represent [Dangerous Individuals or Organizations](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/dangerous_individuals_organizations).
* Create or use an account that demonstrates an intent to violate our Community Standards.
* Create or use an account by scripted or other inauthentic means.
* Create an account, Page, Group or Event to evade our enforcement actions, including creating an account to bypass a restriction or after we have disabled your previous account, Page, Group or Event.
* Create or use an account that deliberately misrepresents your identity in order to mislead or deceive others, or to evade enforcement or violate our other Community Standards. We consider a number of factors when assessing misleading identity misrepresentation, such as:
    * Repeated or significant changes to identity details, such as name or age
    * Misleading profile information, such as bio details and profile location
    * Using stock imagery or stolen photos
    * Other related account activity
* Impersonate others by:
    * Using their photos with the explicit aim to deceive others.
    * Creating an account assuming to be or speak for another person or entity.
    * Creating a Page assuming to be or speak for another person or entity for whom the user is not authorized to do so.
* Are under 13 years old.
* Are a convicted sex offender.
* Are prohibited from receiving our products, services or software under applicable laws.

#### In certain cases, such as those outlined below, we will seek further information about an account before taking actions ranging from temporarily restricting accounts to permanently disabling them.

* Accounts misrepresenting their identity (Facebook and Messenger only) by:
    * Creating an account using a name that is not the [authentic name](https://www.facebook.com/help/112146705538576?ref=ccs) you go by in everyday life
        * Using an inherently violating name, containing slurs or any other violations of the [Community Standards](https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/)
    * Providing a false date of birth.
    * Creating a single account that represents or is used by more than one person.
    * Maintaining multiple accounts as a single user.
* Compromised accounts.

Inauthentic Behavior
====================

#### Policy Rationale

In line with our commitment to authenticity, we do not allow people to misrepresent themselves on Facebook, use fake accounts, artificially boost the popularity of content or engage in behaviors designed to enable other violations under our Community Standards. This policy is intended to protect the security of user accounts and our services, and create a space where people can trust the people and communities they interact with.

#### Do not:

Dangerous Organizations and Individuals
=======================================

#### Policy Rationale

In an effort to prevent and disrupt real-world harm, we do not allow organizations or individuals that proclaim a violent mission or are engaged in violence to have a presence on Meta. We assess these entities based on their behavior both online and offline, most significantly, their ties to violence. Under this policy, we designate individuals, organizations, and networks of people. These designations are divided into two tiers that indicate the level of content enforcement, with Tier 1 resulting in the most extensive enforcement because we believe these entities have the most direct ties to offline harm.

**Tier 1** focuses on entities that engage in serious offline harms - including organizing or advocating for violence against civilians, repeatedly dehumanizing or advocating for harm against people based on protected characteristics, or engaging in systematic criminal operations. Tier 1 includes hate organizations; criminal organizations, including those designated by the United States government as Specially Designated Narcotics Trafficking Kingpins (SDNTKs); and terrorist organizations, including entities and individuals designated by the United States government as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) or Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs). We remove Glorification, Support, and Representation of Tier 1 entities, their leaders, founders or prominent members, as well as unclear references to them.

In addition, we do not allow content that glorifies, supports, or represents events that Meta designates as violating violent events - including terrorist attacks, hate events, multiple-victim violence or attempted multiple-victim violence, serial murders, or hate crimes. Nor do we allow (1) Glorification, Support, or Representation of the perpetrator(s) of such attacks; (2) perpetrator-generated content relating to such attacks; or (3) third-party imagery depicting the moment of such attacks on visible victims. We also remove content that Glorifies, Supports or Represents ideologies that promote hate, such as nazism and white supremacy.We remove unclear references to these designated events or ideologies.

**Tier 2** includes Violent Non-State Actors that engage in violence against state or military actors in an armed conflict but do not intentionally target civilians. It also includes Violence Inducing Entities that are engaged in preparing or advocating for future violence but have not necessarily engaged in violence to date. These are also entities that may repeatedly engage in violations of our Hate Speech or Dangerous Organizations and Individuals policies on or off the platform. We remove Glorification, Material Support, and Representation of these entities, their leaders, founders or prominent members.

We recognize that users may share content that includes references to designated dangerous organizations and individuals in the context of social and political discourse. This includes content reporting on, neutrally discussing or condemning dangerous organizations and individuals or their activities.

In line with international human rights law, our policies allow discussions about the human rights of designated individuals or members of designated dangerous entities, unless the content includes other glorification, support, or representation of designated entities or other policy violations, such as incitement to violence.

Please see our [Corporate Human Rights Policy](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Facebooks-Corporate-Human-Rights-Policy.pdf) for more information about our commitment to internationally recognized human rights.

Adult Sexual Solicitation and Sexually Explicit Language
========================================================

#### Policy Rationale

As noted in the [Adult Sexual Exploitation](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/sexual_exploitation_adults) policy, people use Facebook to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and exploitation. We recognize the importance of and allow for this discussion.We also allow for the discussion of sex worker rights advocacy and sex work regulation. We draw the line, however, when content facilitates sexual encounters or commercial sexual services between adults. We do this to avoid facilitating transactions that may involve trafficking, coercion and non-consensual sexual acts.

We also restrict sexually-explicit language that may lead to sexual solicitation because some audiences within our global community may be sensitive to this type of content, and it may impede the ability for people to connect with their friends and the broader community.

#### Do not post:

Content that offers or asks for prostitution, defined as offering oneself or asking for sexual activities in exchange for money or anything of value such as:

* Offering or asking for sexual activity (for example, escort services, sexual/erotic massages, sex chats/conversations, fetish/domination services)
* Slang terms for prostitution combined with an ask or offer of availability, price, hint at price, or compensation, location, or contact information
* Content that engages in explicit or implicit sexual solicitation combined with a price, hint at price, or compensation

Sexually suggestive elements can include regionalized sexual slang, mentions or depictions of sexual activity (as defined in our Adult Nudity and Sexual Activity policy) or sexual poses.

Content that offers or asks for pornographic material including, but not limited to, sharing of links to external pornographic websites.

Sexually explicit language that goes into graphic detail about:

* An act of sexual intercourse (e.g., sexual penetration, self-pleasuring or exercising fetish scenarios)

We also do not prohibit under the policy content expressing desire for sexual activity, promoting sex education, discussing sexual practices or experiences, or offering classes or programs that teach about sex.

#### For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or context to enforce:

Child Sexual Exploitation, Abuse, and Nudity
============================================

#### Policy Rationale

We do not allow content or activity that sexually exploits or endangers children. When we become aware of apparent child exploitation, we report it to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), in compliance with applicable law. We know that sometimes people share nude images of their own children with good intentions; however, we generally remove these images because of the potential for abuse by others and to help avoid the possibility of other people reusing or misappropriating the images.

We also work with external experts, including the [Facebook Safety Advisory Board](https://www.facebook.com/help/222332597793306?ref=ccs), to discuss and improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, especially with regard to children.

Adult Sexual Exploitation
=========================

#### Policy Rationale

We recognize the importance of Facebook as a place to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and exploitation. In an effort to create space for this conversation and promote a safe environment, we allow victims to share their experiences, but remove content that depicts, threatens or promotes sexual violence, sexual assault, or sexual exploitation. We also remove content that displays, advocates for or coordinates sexual acts with non-consenting parties to avoid facilitating non-consensual sexual acts.

To protect victims and survivors, we remove images that depict incidents of sexual violence and intimate images shared without the consent of the person(s) pictured. As noted in the introduction, we also work with external safety experts to discuss and improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, and we may remove content when they provide information that content is linked to harmful activity. We have written about the [technology we use to protect against intimate images](https://about.fb.com/news/2019/03/detecting-non-consensual-intimate-images/) and the [research that has informed our work](https://about.fb.com/news/2019/03/protecting-intimate-images/). We’ve also put together a [guide to reporting and removing intimate images shared without your consent](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/not-without-my-consent.pdf).

#### Do not post:

In instances where content consists of any form of non-consensual sexual touching, necrophilia, or forced stripping, including:

* Depictions (including real photos/videos except in a real-world art context), or
* Sharing, offering, asking for or threatening to share imagery, or
* Descriptions, unless shared by or in support of the victim/survivor, or
* Advocacy (including aspirational and conditional statements), or
* Statements of intent, or
* Calls for action, or
* Admitting participation, or
* Mocking victims of any of the above.
* We will also take down content shared by a third party that identifies victims or survivors of sexual assault when reported by the victim or survivor.

Content that attempts to exploit people by any of the following:

* Sextortion: Coercing money, favors or intimate imagery from people with threats to expose their intimate imagery or intimate information
* Sharing, threatening, stating an intent to share, offering or asking for non-consensual intimate imagery that fulfills all of the 3 following conditions:
    * Imagery is non-commercial or produced in a private setting.
    * Person in the imagery is (near) nude, engaged in sexual activity or in a sexual pose.
    * Lack of consent to share the imagery is indicated by meeting any of the signals:
        * Vengeful context (such as, caption, comments or page title).
        * Independent sources (such as, law enforcement record) including entertainment media (such as, leak of images confirmed by media).
        * A visible match between the person depicted in the image and the person who has reported the content to us.
        * The person who reported the content to us shares the same name as the person depicted in the image.
* Secretly taken non-commercial imagery of a real person's commonly sexualized body parts (breasts, groin, buttocks, or thighs) or of a real person engaged in sexual activity. This imagery is commonly known as "creepshots" or "upskirts" and includes photos or videos that mock, sexualize or expose the person depicted in the imagery.
* Threatening or stating an intent to share private sexual conversations that meets the following criteria:
    * Lack of consent is indicated by:
        * Vengeful context and/or threatening context, or
        * A visible match between the person depicted in the image and the person who has reported the content to us.
        * The person who reported the content to us shares the same name as the person depicted in the image.

#### For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the content may be disturbing:

Narratives and statements that contain a description of non-consensual sexual touching (written or verbal) that includes details beyond mere naming or mentioning the act if:

* Shared by the victim, or
* Shared by a third party (other than the victim) in support of the victim or condemnation of the act or for general awareness to be determined by context/caption.

Content mocking the concept of non-consensual sexual touching

#### For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or context to enforce:

We may restrict visibility to people over the age of 18 and include a warning label on certain content depicting non-consensual sexual touching, when it is shared to raise awareness and without entertainment or sensational context, where the victim or survivor is not identifiable and where the content does not involve nudity.

In addition to our at-scale policy of removing content that threatens or advocates rape or other non-consensual sexual touching, we may also disable the posting account.

We may also enforce on content shared by a third party that identifies survivors of sexual assault when reported by an authorized representative or Trusted Partner.

Violence and Incitement
=======================

#### Policy Rationale

We aim to prevent potential offline violence that may be related to content on our platforms. While we understand that people commonly express disdain or disagreement by threatening or calling for violence in non-serious and casual ways, we remove language that incites or facilitates violence and credible threats to public or personal safety. This includes violent speech targeting a person or group of people on the basis of their protected characteristic(s) or immigration status. Context matters, so we consider various factors such as condemnation or awareness raising of violent threats, non-credible threats directed at terrorists or other violent actors (e.g. "Terrorists deserve to be killed") or the public visibility and vulnerability of the target of the threats. We remove content, disable accounts, and also work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm or direct threats to public safety.

#### We Remove:

We remove threats of violence against various targets. Threats of violence are statements or visuals representing an intention, aspiration, or call for violence against a target, and threats can be expressed in various types of statements such as statements of intent, calls for action, advocacy, aspirational statements and conditional statements.  
  
**We do not prohibit threats when shared in awareness-raising or condemning context, when less severe threats are made in the context of contact sports, or when threats are directed against certain violent actors, like terrorist groups.**  
  
**Universal protections for everyone**  
Everyone is protected from the following threats:

* Threats of violence that could lead to death (or other forms of high-severity violence)
* Threats of violence that could lead to serious injury (mid-severity violence). We remove such threats against public figures and groups not based on protected characteristics when credible, and we remove them against any other targets (including groups based on protected characteristics) regardless of credibility
* Admissions to high-severity or mid-severity violence (in written or verbal form, or visually depicted by the perpetrator or an associate), except when shared in a context of redemption, self-defense, contact sports (mid-severity or less), or when committed by law enforcement, military or state security personnel
* Threats or depictions of kidnappings or abductions, unless it is clear that the content is being shared by a victim or their family as a plea for help, or shared for informational, condemnation or awareness-raising purposes

**Additional protections for Private Adults, All Children, high-risk persons and persons or groups based on their protected characteristics:**  
In addition to the universal protections for everyone, all private adults (when self-reported), children and persons or groups of people targeted on the basis of their protected characteristic(s), are protected from threats of low-severity violence.

**Other Violence**  
In addition to all of the protections listed above, we remove the following:

* Content that asks for, offers, or admits to offering services of high-severity violence (for example, hitmen, mercenaries, assassins, female genital mutilation) or advocates for the use of these services
* Instructions on how to make or use weapons where there is language explicitly stating the goal to seriously injure or kill people, or imagery that shows or simulates the end result, unless in the context of recreational self-defense, training by a country’s military, commercial video games, or news coverage (posted by Page or with news logo).
* Instructions on how to make or use explosives, unless with context that the content is for a non-violent purpose (for example, part of commercial video games, clear scientific/educational purpose, fireworks, or specifically for fishing)
* Threats to take up weapons or to bring weapons to a location or forcibly enter a location (including but not limited to places of worship, educational facilities, polling places or locations used to count votes or administer an election), or locations where there are temporary signals of a heightened risk of violence.
* Threats of violence related to voting, voter registration, or the administration or outcome of an election, even if there is no target.

#### For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or context to enforce:

We Remove:

* Threats against law enforcement officers or election officials, regardless of their public figure status or credibility of the threat.
* Coded statements where the method of violence is not clearly articulated, but the threat is veiled or implicit, as shown by the combination of both a threat signal and contextual signal from the list below.

* Threat: a coded statement that is one of the following:

* Shared in a retaliatory context (e.g., expressions of desire to engage in violence against others in response to a grievance or threat that may be real, perceived or anticipated)
* References to historical or fictional incidents of violence (e.g., content that threatens others by referring to known historical incidents of violence that have been committed throughout history or in fictional settings)
* Acts as a threatening call to action (e.g., content inviting or encouraging others to carry out violent acts or to join in carrying out the violent acts)
* Indicates knowledge of or shares sensitive information that could expose others to violence (e.g., content that either makes note of or implies awareness of personal information that might make a threat of violence more credible. This includes implying knowledge of a person's residential address, their place of employment or education, daily commute routes or current location)

* Context

* Local context or expertise confirms that the statement in question could lead to imminent violence.
* The target of the content or an authorized representative reports the content to us.

* Implicit threats to bring armaments to locations, including but not limited to places of worship, educational facilities, polling places or locations used to count votes or administer an election (or encouraging others to do the same) or locations where there are temporary signals of a heightened risk of violence.
* Claims or speculation about election-related corruption, irregularities, or bias when combined with a signal that content is threatening violence (e.g., threats to take up or bring a weapon, visual depictions of a weapon, references to arson, theft, vandalism), including:

* Targeting individual(s)
* Targeting a specific location (state or smaller)
* Where the target is not explicit

* References to election-related gatherings or events when combined with a signal that content is threatening violence (e.g., threats to take up or bring a weapon, visual depictions of a weapon, references to arson, theft, vandalism).

Hate Speech
===========

#### Policy Rationale

We believe that people use their voice and connect more freely when they don’t feel attacked on the basis of who they are. That is why we don’t allow hate speech on Facebook, Instagram, or Threads. It creates an environment of intimidation and exclusion, and in some cases may promote offline violence.

We define hate speech as direct attacks against people — rather than concepts or institutions— on the basis of what we call protected characteristics (PCs): race, ethnicity, national origin, disability, religious affiliation, caste, sexual orientation, sex, gender identity, and serious disease. Additionally, we consider age a protected characteristic when referenced along with another protected characteristic. We also protect refugees, migrants, immigrants, and asylum seekers from the most severe attacks, though we do allow commentary on and criticism of immigration policies. Similarly, we provide some protections for non- protected characteristics, such as occupation, when they are referenced along with a protected characteristic. Sometimes, based on local nuance, we consider certain words or phrases as frequently used proxies for PC groups.

We define a hate speech attack as dehumanizing speech; statements of inferiority, expressions of contempt or disgust; cursing; and calls for exclusion or segregation. We also prohibit the use of harmful stereotypes, which we define as dehumanizing comparisons that have historically been used to attack, intimidate, or exclude specific groups, and that are often linked with offline violence. We also prohibit the usage of slurs that are used to attack people on the basis of their protected characteristics. Attacks are separated into two tiers of severity, described below.

We have additional restrictions for paid content.

However, we recognize that people sometimes share content that includes slurs or someone else’s hate speech in order to condemn the speech or raise awareness of it. In other cases, speech, including slurs, that might otherwise violate our standards is used self-referentially or in an empowering way. People also sometimes express contempt or curse at a gender in the context of a romantic break-up. Other times, they use gender-exclusive language to control membership in a health or positive support group, such as a breastfeeding group for women only. Our policies are designed to allow room for these types of speech but require people to clearly indicate their intent. Where intention is unclear, we may remove content.

Note: Violent speech targeting people on the basis of their protected characteristics is covered in our Violence and Incitement Policy.

#### Do not post:

**Tier 1**

Content targeting a person or group of people (including all groups except those who are considered non-protected groups described as having carried out violent crimes or sexual offenses or representing less than half of a group) on the basis of their aforementioned protected characteristic(s) or immigration status in written or visual form with:

* Mocking people on the basis of their Protected Characteristics or Quasi-Protected Characteristics for having or experiencing a disease.

* Content that describes or negatively targets people with slurs, where slurs are defined as words that inherently create an atmosphere of exclusion and intimidation against people on the basis of a protected characteristic, often because these words are tied to historical discrimination, oppression, and violence.

* Content attacking concepts, institutions, ideas, practices, or beliefs associated with protected characteristics, which are likely to contribute to imminent physical harm, intimidation or discrimination against the people associated with that protected characteristic. Meta looks at a range of signs to determine whether there is a threat of harm in the content. These include but are not limited to: content that could incite imminent violence or intimidation; whether there is a period of heightened tension such as an election or ongoing conflict; and whether there is a recent history of violence against the targeted protected group. In some cases, we may also consider whether the speaker is a public figure or occupies a position of authority.
* Content targeting a person or group of people on the basis of their protected characteristic(s) with claims that they have or spread the novel coronavirus, are responsible for the existence of the novel coronavirus, are deliberately spreading the novel coronavirus.

In certain cases, we will allow content that may otherwise violate the Community Standards when it is determined that the content is satirical. Content will only be allowed if the violating elements of the content are being satirized or attributed to something or someone else in order to mock or criticize them.

Bullying and Harassment
=======================

#### Policy Rationale

Bullying and harassment happen in many places and come in many different forms from making threats and releasing personally identifiable information to sending threatening messages and making unwanted malicious contact. We do not tolerate this kind of behavior because it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on Facebook, Instagram, and Threads.

We distinguish between public figures and private individuals because we want to allow discussion, which often includes critical commentary of people who are featured in the news or who have a large public audience. For public figures, we remove attacks that are severe as well as certain attacks where the public figure is directly tagged in the post or comment. We define public figures as state and national level government officials, political candidates for those offices, people with over one million fans or followers on social media and people who receive substantial news coverage.

For private individuals, our protection goes further: We remove content that's meant to degrade or shame, including, for example, claims about someone's sexual activity. We recognize that bullying and harassment can have more of an emotional impact on minors, which is why our policies provide heightened protection for anyone under the age 18, regardless of user status.

Context and intent matter, and we allow people to post and share if it is clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to bullying and harassment. In certain instances, we require self-reporting because it helps us understand that the person targeted feels bullied or harassed. In addition to reporting such behavior and content, we encourage people to use [tools available on our platforms](https://www.facebook.com/safety/tools) to help protect against it.

We also have a [Bullying Prevention Hub](https://www.facebook.com/safety/bullying), which is a resource for teens, parents, and educators seeking support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers step-by-step guidance, including information on how to start important conversations about bullying. Learn more about what we are doing to protect people from bullying and harassment [here](https://about.fb.com/news/2018/10/protecting-people-from-bullying/).

Note: This policy does not apply to individuals who are part of designated organizations under the [Dangerous Organizations and Individuals policy](https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/dangerous-individuals-organizations/) or individuals who died prior to 1900.

Suicide, Self Injury, and Eating Disorders
==========================================

#### Policy Rationale

We care deeply about the safety of the people who use our apps. We regularly consult with experts in suicide, self-injury and eating disorders to help inform our policies and enforcement, and work with organizations around the world to provide assistance to people in distress.

While we do not allow people to intentionally or unintentionally celebrate or promote suicide, self-injury, or eating disorders, we do allow people to discuss these topics because we want Facebook to be a space where people can share their experiences, raise awareness about these issues, and seek support from one another.

We remove any content that encourages suicide, self-injury, or eating disorders, including fictional content such as memes or illustrations and any self-injury content which is graphic, regardless of context. We also remove content that mocks victims or surivors of suicide, self-injury or eating disorders, as well as real time depictions of suicide or self-injury. Content about recovery from suicide, self-injury, or eating disorders that is allowed, but may contain imagery that could be upsetting, such as a healed scar, is placed behind a sensitivity screen.

When people post or search for suicide, self-injury, or eating disorders related content, we will direct them to local organizations that can provide support and if our Community Operations team is concerned about immediate harm we will contact local emergency services to get them help. For more information, visit the [Facebook Safety Center.](https://www.facebook.com/safety/wellbeing/suicideprevention)

With respect to live content, experts have told us that if someone is saying they intend to attempt suicide on a livestream, we should leave the content up for as long as possible, because the longer someone is talking to a camera, the more opportunity there is for a friend or family member to call emergency services.

However, to minimize the risk of others being negatively impacted by viewing this content, we will stop the livestream at the point at which the threat turns into an attempt. As mentioned above, in any case, we will contact emergency services if we identify someone is at immediate risk of harming themselves.

#### Do not post:

Content that promotes, encourages, coordinates, or provides instructions for

* Suicide.
* Self-injury.
* Eating disorders.

Content that depicts graphic self-injury imagery

It is against our policies to post content depicting a person who engaged in a suicide attempt or death by suicide

Content that focuses on depiction of ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave stomach, or protruding spine or scapula when shared together with terms associated with eating disorders

Content that contains instructions for drastic and unhealthy weight loss when shared together with terms associated with eating disorders.

Content that mocks victims or survivors of suicide, self-injury or eating disorders who are either publicly known or implied to have experienced suicide or self-injury

We try to identify suicide notes using several factors, including but not limited to, family or legal representative requests, media reports, law enforcement reports or other third party sources (e.g. government agencies, NGOs).
    * A suicide note may also be removed when reported through the [Suicidal Content Contact Form](https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/305410456169423/) or [Instagram Contact Form](https://help.instagram.com/contact/383679321740945/) when we have confirmation of a suicide or suicide attempt

Violent and Graphic Content
===========================

#### Policy Rationale

To protect users from disturbing imagery, we remove content that is particularly violent or graphic, such as videos depicting dismemberment, visible innards or charred bodies. We also remove content that contains sadistic remarks towards imagery depicting the suffering of humans and animals.

In the context of discussions about important issues such as human rights abuses, armed conflicts or acts of terrorism, we allow graphic content (with some limitations) to help people to condemn and raise awareness about these situations.

We know that people have different sensitivities with regard to graphic and violent imagery. For that reason, we add a warning label to some graphic or violent imagery so that people are aware it may be sensitive before they click through. We also restrict the ability for users under 18 to view such content.

#### Do not post:

**Imagery of people**

Videos of people or dead bodies in non-medical settings if they depict

* Dismemberment.
* Visible internal organs; partially decomposed bodies.
* Charred or burning people unless in the context of cremation or self-immolation when that action is a form of political speech or newsworthy.
* Victims of cannibalism.
* Throat-slitting.

Live streams of capital punishment of a person

**Sadistic Remarks**

* Sadistic remarks towards imagery that is put behind a warning screen under this policy advising people that the content may be disturbing, unless there is a self-defense context or medical setting.

    * Imagery of one or more persons subjected to violence and/or humiliating acts by one or more uniformed personnel doing a police function.
    * Imagery of fetuses and babies outside of the womb that are deceased.
    * Explicit sadistic remarks towards the suffering of animals depicted in the imagery.
* Offering or soliciting imagery that is deleted or put behind a warning screen under this policy, when accompanied by sadistic remarks.
