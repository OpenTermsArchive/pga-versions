Community Guidelines
====================

On November 12, 2024, these guidelines will move to our [Transparency Center](https://transparency.meta.com/policies/community-standards/) and we will refer to them as the Community Standards. This is part of our efforts to streamline your experience and make things easier to find. None of the standards will change and they will continue to apply across Instagram, Threads, Facebook, and Messenger.

_**COVID-19: Community Guidelines Updates and Protections:** As people around the world confront this unprecedented public health emergency, we want to make sure that our Community Guidelines protect people from harmful content and new types of abuse related to COVID-19. We’re working to remove content that has the potential to contribute to real-world harm, including through our policies prohibiting coordination of harm, sale of medical masks and related goods, hate speech, bullying and harassment and misinformation that contributes to the risk of imminent violence or physical harm. To learn more about our policies on COVID-19 and vaccines, [see here.](https://help.instagram.com/697825587576762?helpref=faq_content)_

The Short[#](#the-short)
------------------------

We want Instagram to continue to be an authentic and safe place for inspiration and expression. Help us foster this community. Post only your own photos and videos and always follow the law. Respect everyone on Instagram, don’t spam people or post nudity.

The Long[#](#the-long)
----------------------

Instagram is a reflection of our diverse community of cultures, ages, and beliefs. We’ve spent a lot of time thinking about the different points of view that create a safe and open environment for everyone.

We created the Community Guidelines so you can help us foster and protect this amazing community. By using Instagram, you agree to these guidelines and our [Terms of Use](https://www.instagram.com/legal/terms). We’re committed to these guidelines and we hope you are too. Overstepping these boundaries may result in deleted content, [disabled accounts](https://help.instagram.com/366993040048856?helpref=faq_content), or other restrictions.

In some cases, we allow content for public awareness which would otherwise go against our Community Guidelines – if it is newsworthy and in the public interest. We do this only after weighing the public interest value against the risk of harm and we look to international human rights standards to make these judgments.

* **Share only photos and videos that you’ve taken or have the right to share.**
    
    As always, you own the content you post on Instagram. Remember to post authentic content, and don’t post anything you’ve copied or collected from the Internet that you don’t have the right to post. Learn more about [intellectual property rights](https://help.instagram.com/126382350847838?helpref=faq_content).
    
* **Post photos and videos that are appropriate for a diverse audience.**
    
    We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don’t allow [nudity](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/adult_nudity_sexual_activity) on Instagram. This includes photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos in the context of breastfeeding, birth giving and after-birth moments, health-related situations (for example, post-mastectomy, breast cancer awareness or gender confirmation surgery) or an act of protest are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings and sculptures is OK, too.
    
    People like to share photos or videos of their children. For safety reasons, there are times when we may remove images that show [nude or partially-nude children](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/child_nudity_sexual_exploitation). Even when this content is shared with good intentions, it could be used by others in unanticipated ways. You can learn more on our [Tips for Parents page](https://help.instagram.com/154475974694511/?helpref=faq_content).
    
* **Foster meaningful and genuine interactions.**
    
    Help us stay [spam-free](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/spam) by not artificially collecting likes, followers, or shares, posting repetitive comments or content, or repeatedly contacting people for commercial purposes without their consent. Don’t offer money or giveaways of money in exchange for likes, followers, comments or other engagement. Don’t post content that engages in, promotes, encourages, facilitates, or admits to the offering, solicitation or trade of [fake and misleading user reviews or ratings](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/fraud_deception).
    
    You don’t have to use your real name on Instagram, but we do require Instagram users to provide us with accurate and up to date information. Don't [impersonate](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/misrepresentation) others and don't create accounts for the purpose of violating our guidelines or [misleading others](https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/inauthentic-behavior/).
    
* **Follow the law.**
    
    Instagram is not a place to support or praise [terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/dangerous_individuals_organizations). Offering [sexual services](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/sexual_solicitation), buying or selling firearms, alcohol, and tobacco products between private individuals, and buying or selling non-medical or pharmaceutical drugs are also not allowed. We also remove content that attempts to trade, co-ordinate the trade of, donate, gift, or ask for non-medical drugs, as well as content that either admits to personal use (unless in the recovery context) or coordinates or promotes the use of non-medical drugs. Instagram also prohibits the sale of live animals between private individuals, though brick-and-mortar stores may offer these sales. No one may coordinate poaching or selling of endangered species or their parts.
    
    Remember to always follow the law when offering to sell or buy other [regulated goods](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/regulated_goods). Accounts promoting online gambling, online real money games of skill or online lotteries must get our prior written permission before using any of our products.
    
    We have zero tolerance when it comes to sharing [sexual content involving minors](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/child_nudity_sexual_exploitation) or threatening to post [intimate images](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/sexual_exploitation_adults) of others.
    
* **Respect other members of the Instagram community.**
    
    We want to foster a positive, diverse community. We remove content that contains [credible threats](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/credible_violence) or [hate speech](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/hate_speech), content that targets private individuals to [degrade or shame them](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/bullying), personal information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large public audience due to their profession or chosen activities.
    
    It's never OK to encourage violence or attack anyone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disabilities, or diseases. When hate speech is being shared to challenge it or to raise awareness, we may allow it. In those instances, we ask that you express your intent clearly.
    
    [Serious threats of harm](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/credible_violence) to public and personal safety aren't allowed. This includes specific threats of physical harm as well as threats of theft, vandalism, and other financial harm. We carefully review reports of threats and consider many things when determining whether a threat is credible.
    
* **Maintain our supportive environment by not glorifying self-injury.**
    
    The Instagram community cares for each other, and is often a place where people facing difficult issues such as eating disorders, cutting, or other kinds of self-injury come together to create awareness or find support. We try to do our part by providing education in the app and adding information in the [Help Center](https://help.instagram.com/) so people can get the help they need.
    
    Encouraging or urging people to embrace [self-injury](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/suicide_self_injury_violence) is counter to this environment of support, and we’ll remove it or disable accounts if it’s reported to us. We may also remove content identifying victims or survivors of self-injury if the content targets them for attack or humor.
    
* **Be thoughtful when posting newsworthy events.**
    
    We understand that many people use Instagram to share important and newsworthy events. Some of these issues can involve graphic images. Because so many different people and age groups use Instagram, we may remove videos of intense, [graphic violence](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/graphic_violence) to make sure Instagram stays appropriate for everyone.
    
    We understand that people often share this kind of content to condemn, raise awareness or educate. If you do share content for these reasons, we encourage you to caption your photo with a warning about graphic violence. Sharing [graphic images for sadistic pleasure](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/cruel_insensitive) or to glorify violence is never allowed.
    

Help us keep the community strong:

* Each of us is an important part of the Instagram community. If you see something that you think may violate our guidelines, please help us by using our [built-in reporting option](https://help.instagram.com/165828726894770?helpref=faq_content). We have a global team that reviews these reports and works as quickly as possible to remove content that doesn’t meet our guidelines. Even if you or someone you know doesn’t have an Instagram account, you can still [file a report](https://help.instagram.com/contact/383679321740945). When you complete the report, try to provide as much information as possible, such as links, usernames, and descriptions of the content, so we can find and review it quickly. We may remove entire posts if either the imagery or associated captions violate our guidelines.
* You may find content you don’t like, but doesn’t violate the Community Guidelines. If that happens, you can [unfollow](https://help.instagram.com/286340048138725?helpref=faq_content) or [block](https://help.instagram.com/426700567389543/?helpref=faq_content) the person who posted it. If there's something you don't like in a comment on one of your posts, you can [delete that comment](https://help.instagram.com/289098941190483?helpref=faq_content).
* Many disputes and misunderstandings can be resolved directly between members of the community. If one of your photos or videos was posted by someone else, you could try commenting on the post and asking the person to take it down. If that doesn’t work, you can [file a copyright report](https://help.instagram.com/126382350847838?helpref=faq_content). If you believe someone is violating your trademark, you can [file a trademark report](https://help.instagram.com/222826637847963?helpref=faq_content). Don't target the person who posted it by posting screenshots and drawing attention to the situation because that may be classified as harassment.
* We may work with law enforcement, including when we believe that there’s risk of physical harm or threat to public safety.

Adult Nudity and Sexual Activity
================================

Policy Rationale

We restrict the display of nudity or sexual activity because some people in our community may be sensitive to this type of content, particularly due to cultural background or age.

We understand that nudity can be shared for a variety of reasons, including as a form of protest, to raise awareness about a cause or for educational or medical reasons. Where appropriate and such intent is clear, we make allowances for the content. For example, while we restrict some images of female breasts that include the nipple, we allow other images, including those depicting acts of protest, women actively engaged in breast-feeding and photos of post-mastectomy scarring. We also allow real world art that depicts nudity such as photographs of paintings, sculptures, etc. We default to removing sexual imagery to prevent the sharing of non-consensual or underage content.

Under this policy, we remove real photographs and videos of nudity and sexual activity, AI- or computer-generated images of nudity and sexual activity, and digital imagery, regardless of whether it looks “photorealistic” (as in, it looks like a real person). As noted above, we also make careful allowances for real world art and certain medical, educational, and awareness-raising content, and these are detailed in the policy.

Content relating to child nudity is addressed in our Community Standard on [Child Sexual Exploitation, Abuse and Nudity](https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/child-sexual-exploitation-abuse-nudity/).

We do not allow:

* Imagery, and digital imagery, of adult nudity, if it depicts:
    * Visible genitalia (including when obscured by pubic hair) except when labeled with a sensitive warning screen in a medical or health context (for example, birth giving and after-birth moments, gender confirmation surgery, examination for cancer or other diseases)
    * Visible anuses and/or fully nude close-ups of buttocks except when labeled with a sensitive warning screen in a medical or health context or when edited onto a public figure
    * Uncovered female nipples, except in a breastfeeding, mastectomy, medical, health, or act of protest context
    * Note that we allow all the above in the context of famine, genocide, war crimes, or crimes against humanity
* Imagery of adult sexual activity, including:
    * Explicit sexual activity or stimulation

    * Other sexual activity or stimulation, except when labeled with a sensitive warning screen in a medical or health context, or when limited to adults, ages 18 years or older, promotional content, recognised fictional images or images with indicators of fiction:

        * Acts that are likely to lead to the death of a person or animal
        * Dismemberment
        * Cannibalism

* In certain cases, we will allow content that may otherwise violate the Community Standards when it is determined that the content is satirical. Content will only be allowed if the violating elements of the content are being satirized or attributed to something or someone else in order to mock or criticize them.

Child Sexual Exploitation, Abuse, and Nudity
============================================

Policy Rationale

We do not allow content or activity that sexually exploits or endangers children. When we become aware of apparent child exploitation, we report it to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), in compliance with applicable law. We know that sometimes people share nude images of their own children with good intentions; however, we generally remove these images because of the potential for abuse by others and to help avoid the possibility of other people reusing or misappropriating the images.

We also work with external experts, including the [Meta Safety Advisory Board](https://www.facebook.com/help/222332597793306?ref=ccs), to discuss and improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, especially with regard to children. Learn more about the [technology we’re using to fight against child exploitation](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/10/fighting-child-exploitation/).

Do not post:

In addition to removing accounts that violate our Child Sexual Exploitation, Abuse and Nudity (CSEAN) policies, our reviewers and automated systems consider a broad spectrum of signals to help prevent potentially unwanted or unsafe interactions.

* We may restrict access to products and features (e.g., the ability to message certain other users) for adults based on their interactions with other accounts, searches for or interactions with violating content, or membership in communities (e.g. Groups) we have removed for violating our policies.

* Videos or photos of violent immersion of a child in water in the context of religious rituals

For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or context to enforce:

For the following content, we include a warning label so that people are aware that the content may be sensitive:

Spam
====

Policy Rationale

We do not allow content that is designed to deceive, mislead, or overwhelm users in order to artificially increase viewership. This content detracts from people's ability to engage authentically on our platforms and can threaten the security, stability and usability of our services. We also seek to prevent abusive tactics, such as spreading deceptive links to draw unsuspecting users in through misleading functionality or code, or impersonating a trusted domain.

Online spam is a lucrative industry. Our policies and detection must constantly evolve to keep up with emerging spam trends and tactics. In taking action to combat spam, we seek to balance raising the costs for its producers and distributors on our platforms, with protecting the vibrant, authentic activity of our community.

We do not allow:

* Posting, sharing, engaging with content or creating accounts, Groups, Pages, Events or other assets, either manually or automatically, at very high frequencies.
    * We may place restrictions on accounts that are acting at lower frequencies when other indicators of Spam (e.g., posting repetitive content) or signals of inauthenticity are present.

* Attempting to or successfully selling, buying, or exchanging platform assets, such as accounts, groups, pages, etc.
* Attempting to or successfully selling, buying, or exchanging site privileges, such as admin or moderator roles, or permission to post in specific spaces.
* Attempting to or successfully selling, buying, or exchanging content for something of monetary value, except clearly identified Branded Content, as defined by our [Branded Content Policy](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/221149188908254).
* Attempting to or successfully selling, buying, or exchanging for engagement, such as likes, shares, views, follows, clicks, use of specific hashtags, etc. This includes:
    * Offering giveaways (i.e., offering others a chance to win) of cash or cash equivalents in exchange for engagement. (e.g., “Anyone that likes my page will be entered to win $500”)
    * Offering to provide anything of monetary value in exchange for engagement. (e.g., “If you like my page, I will give you an iPhone!”)

* Requiring or claiming that users are required to engage with content (e.g., liking, sharing) before they are able to view or interact with promised content.
* Sharing deceptive or misleading URLs, domains, or applications including:
    * **[Cloaking](https://about.fb.com/news/2017/08/news-feed-fyi-addressing-cloaking-so-people-see-more-authentic-posts/)**: Cloaking is any attempt to circumvent our content policies by intentionally presenting different off-platform content, such as URLs or applications, to our integrity systems versus what is shown to users.
    * **Misleading Links**: Content containing a link that promises one type of content but delivers something substantially different.This can include content in a promised app or software.
    * **Deceptive redirect behavior**: Websites that require an action (e.g. captcha, watch ad, click here) in order to view the expected landing page content and the domain name of the URL changes after the required action is complete, or automatically redirects users to a substantially different domain without any user action.
    * **Like/share-gating**: Requiring users to engage (in the form of likes, shares, follows, or any other public-facing form of engagement) to gain access to specific, exclusive content.
    * **Deceptive platform functionality** - Mimicking the features or functionality of our services, such as mimicking fundraising, in-line polls, play buttons, or the Like button where that functionality does not exist or does not function as expected, in order to get a user to follow a link.
    * **Deceptive landing page functionality**: Websites that have a misleading user interface, which results in accidental traffic being generated (e.g. pop-ups/unders, clickjacking, etc.).This includes tactics like trapping, where irrelevant pop-ups appear when a person attempts to leave the landing page.
    * **Landing page or domain impersonation** - An off-platform landing page, URL, or external website or domain that pretends to be a reputable brand or service by using a name, domain or content that features typos, misspellings or other means to impersonate well-known websites, domains or brands using a landing page similar to another, trusted site.
    * Other deceptive uses of URLs or links that are substantially similar to the above.

* Notwithstanding the above, we do not prohibit:
    * Cross promotion that is not triggered by payment to a third party
    * Transferring admin or moderation responsibilities for a page or group to another user based on their interest in the page or group, rather than an exchange of value.
    * Posting or sharing clearly identified Branded Content.

Fraud, Scams, and Deceptive Practices
=====================================

Policy Rationale

We aim to protect users and businesses from being deceived out of their money, property or personal information. We achieve this by removing content and combatting behavior that purposefully employs deceptive means - such as wilful misrepresentation, stolen information and exaggerated claims - to either scam or defraud users and businesses, or to drive engagement. This includes content that seeks to coordinate or promote those activities using our services. We allow people to raise awareness and educate others as well as condemn these activities.

We do not allow:

Content that attempts to scam or defraud users and/or businesses by means of:

**Loan Fraud and Scams**

Content that:

* Offers loans requiring the user to pay an advance fee to obtain a loan.
* Offers loans with guarantee or near-guarantee of approval, either explicitly stated or implicitly understood based on context (such as claims to approve loan without asking for financial information).
* Note: We also look for other signals to determine if an entity is posting legitimate, non-fraudulent content, such as when it is a verified entity and a bank or financial institution.

**Gambling Fraud and Scams**

Content that:

* Offers real money gambling services (“Real money” is real-world currency that can be used to buy goods or services in the real world, including national currencies such as U.S. Dollars and virtual currencies such as Bitcoin):
    * with a guarantee of winning.
    * implying or admitting to have rigged the outcome of a game or match.
    * soliciting people to enable match fixing or looking for help or tips on how to fix a match or game.

Social casino games that simulate gambling with no opportunity to win real money fall under our [Community Standard for Restricted Goods and Services](https://transparency.meta.com/policies/community-standards/regulated-goods/).

**Investment or Financial Fraud and Scams**

* _Investment Opportunities._ Content that:
    * Offers investment opportunities where returns on investment are guaranteed or risk-free.
    * Offers investment opportunities where returns on investment or compensation is partly or fully based on recruitment of others to participate in the scheme.
    * Offers investment opportunities where the opportunity is of a “get-rich-quick” nature and/or claims that a small investment can be turned into a large amount.

* _Money/Cash Flip._ Content that:
    * Offers to turn a certain sum of money into a larger one through flipping or trick or strategy involving explicit mentions of ”cash flip,” "money flip,” or similar terminology.

**Money Muling and Laundering Fraud and Scams**

* _Money Muling._ Content that:
    * Offers or asks for money muling (causing victims to be unknowing participants in money laundering by offering money or share of profits in exchange for allowing others to use their bank accounts or transferring money on behalf of others).

Account Integrity
=================

Policy Rationale

In order to maintain a safe environment and empower free expression, we restrict or remove accounts that are harmful to the community. We have built a combination of automated and manual systems to restrict and remove accounts that are used to egregiously or persistently violate our policies across any of our products.

Because account removal is a serious action, whenever possible, we aim to give our community opportunities to learn our rules and follow our Community Standards. For example, a notification is issued each time we remove content, and in most cases we also provide people with information about the nature of the violation and any restrictions that are applied. Our enforcement actions are designed to be proportional to the severity of the violation, the history of violations on the account, and the risk or harm posed to the community. Continued violations, despite repeated warnings and restrictions, or violations that pose severe safety risks will lead to an account being disabled.

Learn more about how Meta enforces its policies and restricts accounts in the [Transparency Center](https://transparency.fb.com/en-gb/enforcement/taking-action/restricting-accounts/).

We may restrict or disable accounts, other entities (Pages, groups, events) or business assets (Business Managers, ad accounts) that:

* Violate our Community Standards involving egregious harms, including those we refer to law enforcement due to the risk of imminent harm to individual or public safety
* Violate our Community Standards involving any harms that warrant referral to law enforcement due to the risk of imminent harm to individual of public safety
* Violate our Advertising Standards involving deceptive or dangerous business harms
* Persistently violate our Community Standards by posting violating content and/or managing violating entities or business assets
* Persistently violates our Advertising Standards
* Activity or behavior indicative of a clear violating purpose

We may restrict or disable accounts, other entities (Pages, groups, events) or business assets (Business Managers, ad accounts) that are:

* Owned by the same person or entity as an account that has been disabled
* Created or repurposed to evade a previous account or entity removal, including those assessed to have common ownership and content as previously removed accounts or entities
* Created to contact a user that has blocked an account
* Otherwise used to evade our enforcement actions or review processes

We may restrict or disable accounts, other entities (Pages, groups, events) or business assets (Business Managers, ad accounts) that demonstrate:

* Close linkage with a network of accounts or other entities that violate or evade our policies
* Coordination within a network of accounts or other entities that persistently or egregiously violate our policies
* Activity or behavior indicative of a clear violating purpose through a network of accounts

We may restrict or disable accounts or other entities (Pages, groups, events), or business assets (Business Managers, ad accounts) that engage in off-platform activity that can lead to harm on our platform, including those:

* Owned by a convicted sex offender
* Owned by a Designated Entity or run on their behalf
* Prohibited from receiving our products, services or software under applicable laws

In the following scenarios, we may request additional information about an account to ascertain ownership and/or permissible activity:

* Compromised accounts
* Creating or using an account or other entity through automated means, such as scripting (unless the scripting activity occurs through authorized routes and does not otherwise violate our policies)
* Empty accounts with prolonged dormancy

Authentic Identity Representation
=================================

Policy Rationale

Authenticity is the cornerstone of our community. We believe that authenticity helps create a community where people are accountable to each other, and to Meta, in meaningful ways. We want to allow for the many ways that identity is expressed across our global community, while preventing impersonation and identity misrepresentation. To maintain a safe and open environment where people can trust one another and build community, we do not allow for the creation of accounts or profiles that are created or used to deceive others.

On Facebook, we require people to create one account using the name they go by in everyday life that represents their authentic identity. We created [Additional Profiles](https://www.facebook.com/help/967154637433480) to help people express different parts of their identity, such as their interests or businesses.

We do not allow the use of our services and will restrict or disable Facebook, Instagram, and Threads accounts or other Facebook entities (such as Pages, groups) that:

* Belong to underage children
* Impersonate another person or entity by:
    * Using their image(s), name, or likeness with the aim to deceive others
    * Speaking in the voice of another person or entity for whom the user is not authorized to do so (e.g. by creating a Page or Profile)
* Engage in identity misrepresentation to mislead or deceive others, evade enforcement, or violate our Community Standards. We consider a number of factors when assessing misleading identity misrepresentation, such as:
    * Repeated or significant changes to identity details, such as name or age
    * Misleading profile information, such as bio details and profile location
    * Using stock imagery
* Use a name containing violations of our Community Standards.

On Facebook, we will seek further information before taking actions ranging from temporarily restricting to permanently disabling profiles or accounts if you:

* Provide a false date of birth
* Use a name that is not the authentic name you go by in everyday life
* Create a single account that represents or is used by more than one person
* Create or maintain multiple Facebook accounts
* Create an account that represents a non-human entity, such as a business, pet, or fictional character
* Maintain empty profiles with prolonged dormancy

Inauthentic Behavior
====================

Policy Rationale

In line with our commitment to authenticity, we don't allow people to misrepresent themselves on our services, use fake accounts, artificially boost the popularity of content, or engage in behaviors designed to enable other violations under our Community Standards. Inauthentic Behavior refers to a variety of complex forms of deception, performed by a network of inauthentic assets controlled by the same individual or individuals, with the goal of deceiving Meta or our community or to evade enforcement under the Community Standards.

Where adversarial threat actors use fake accounts to engage in sophisticated Inauthentic tactics in order to influence public debate - they engage in what we’ve defined as Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior - or coordinated efforts to manipulate public debate for a strategic goal, in which fake accounts are central to the operation. This violating behavior receives a more severe and often bespoke response, in keeping with their more substantial and sophisticated efforts to deceive. Whenever possible, we share our findings about networks of Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior in our Quarterly Adversarial Threat Reports, found [here](https://transparency.fb.com/en-gb/metasecurity/threat-reporting). These reports are not meant to cover the entire universe of enforcements under the Inauthentic Behavior policy, but help inform our community’s understanding of the evolving nature of threats we face in this space.

While Inauthentic Behavior is often associated with civic or political content, and we are committed to preventing Inauthentic Behavior in the context of elections - these enforcement actions and standards apply agnostic of content, political or otherwise. This policy is intended to protect the authenticity of debate and discussion on our services, and create a space where people can trust the people and communities they interact with.

We do not allow:

* The creation, use, or claimed use of Inauthentic Meta Assets (Accounts, Pages, Groups, etc.) in order to:
    
    * Deceive Meta or our users about:
    
    * The identity, purpose, or origin of an audience or the entity that they represent; or
    * the popularity of content or assets on our services; or
    * a Meta asset’s ownership or control network.
    
    * To Evade enforcement under the Community Standards.
    * Misuse Meta reporting systems to harass, intimidate or silence others.

* Engaging in complex deception through the use of Meta Assets, including:
    * **Inauthentic Distribution:** Using a connected network of inauthentic Meta assets to increase the distribution of content, in order to mislead Meta or its users about the popularity of the content in question.
    * **Inauthentic Audience Building:** Using inauthentic Meta assets to increase the viewership or following of network assets, in order to mislead Meta or its users about the origin, ownership or purpose of an asset or assets.
    * **Foreign Inauthentic Behavior:** Foreign entities using Inauthentic Meta assets to falsely represent a domestic or local voice, in order to deceive an audience about the identity, purpose or origin of the entity they represent.
    * **Inauthentic Engagement:** Using a connected network of inauthentic Meta assets to deliver substantial quantities of fake engagement in ways designed to look authentic, in order to deceive Meta and its users about the popularity of content.
    * **Substantially Similar Deceptions:** Other substantially similar claimed or actual efforts by relatively sophisticated, connected networks of inauthentic Meta assets to deceive Meta or its users about the origin, popularity, or purpose of content.

For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or context to enforce:

We do not allow:

* Entities to engage in, or claim to engage in **Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior**, defined as particularly sophisticated forms of Inauthentic Behavior where inauthentic accounts are central to the operation and operators:
    * Use adversarial methods to evade detection or appear authentic; and
    * Use a variety of adversarial and inauthentic techniques to achieve overarching strategic objectives; and
    * Primarily seek to manipulate public debate.

* Entities to engage in, or claim to engage in **Foreign Interference**, defined as Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior where the network operators are not located in the same country as the audience the operation targets.
* Entities to engage in, or claim to engage in **Government Interference**, defined as Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior where the operation is attributable to a government actor.
* Governments that have instituted sustained blocks of social media to use their official departments, agencies, and embassies to deny the use of force or violent events in the context of an attack against the territorial integrity of another state in violation of Article 2(4) of the UN charter.

Dangerous Organizations and Individuals
=======================================

Policy Rationale

In an effort to prevent and disrupt real-world harm, we do not allow organizations or individuals that proclaim a violent mission or are engaged in violence to have a presence on our platforms. We assess these entities based on their behavior both online and offline, most significantly, their ties to violence. Under this policy, we designate individuals, organizations, and networks of people. These designations are divided into two tiers that indicate the level of content enforcement, with Tier 1 resulting in the most extensive enforcement because we believe these entities have the most direct ties to offline harm.

**Tier 1** focuses on entities that engage in serious offline harms - including organizing or advocating for violence against civilians, repeatedly dehumanizing or advocating for harm against people based on protected characteristics, or engaging in systematic criminal operations. Tier 1 includes hate organizations; criminal organizations, including those designated by the United States government as Specially Designated Narcotics Trafficking Kingpins (SDNTKs); and terrorist organizations, including entities and individuals designated by the United States government as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) or Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs). We remove Glorification, Support, and Representation of Tier 1 entities, their leaders, founders or prominent members, as well as unclear references to them.

In addition, we do not allow content that glorifies, supports, or represents events that Meta designates as violating violent events - including terrorist attacks, hate events, multiple-victim violence or attempted multiple-victim violence, serial murders, or hate crimes. Nor do we allow (1) Glorification, Support, or Representation of the perpetrator(s) of such attacks; (2) perpetrator-generated content relating to such attacks; or (3) third-party imagery depicting the moment of such attacks on visible victims. We also remove content that Glorifies, Supports or Represents ideologies that promote hate, such as nazism and white supremacy.We remove unclear references to these designated events or ideologies.

**Tier 2** includes Violent Non-State Actors that engage in violence against state or military actors in an armed conflict but do not intentionally target civilians. It also includes Violence Inducing Entities that are engaged in preparing or advocating for future violence but have not necessarily engaged in violence to date. These are also entities that may repeatedly engage in violations of our Hate Speech or Dangerous Organizations and Individuals policies on or off the platform. We remove Glorification, Material Support, and Representation of these entities, their leaders, founders or prominent members.

We recognize that users may share content that includes references to designated dangerous organizations and individuals in the context of social and political discourse. This includes content reporting on, neutrally discussing or condemning dangerous organizations and individuals or their activities.

News reporting includes information that is shared to raise awareness about local and global events in which designated dangerous organizations and individuals are involved.

* E.g. “Breaking News: Al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the attack in Somalia”
* E.g. “Timeline and expert analysis: How the shooting at the Buffalo Supermarket unfolded and what did the perpetrator say in court”

Neutral discussion includes factual statements, commentary, questions, and other information that do not express positive judgment around the designated dangerous organization or individual and their behavior.

* E.g. “Al Qaeda represents less threat than ISIS given the lack of leadership and finance”
* E.g. “Anders Breivik is one example of how complex the radicalization process can be”

Condemnation includes disapproval, disgust, rejection, criticism, mockery, and other negative expressions about a designated dangerous organization or individual and their behavior.

* E.g. “I feel disgusted by the crime of Salvador Ramos. The judge’s words resonated so much to me. He should get no mercy by the court”
* E.g. “Hitler’s crimes shall never be forgotten ever. These were some of the darkest moments in history”

Our policies are designed to allow room for these types of discussions while simultaneously limiting risks of potential offline harm. We thus require people to clearly indicate their intent when creating or sharing such content. If a user's intention is ambiguous or unclear, we default to removing content.

In line with international human rights law, our policies allow discussions about the human rights of designated individuals or members of designated dangerous entities, unless the content includes other glorification, support, or representation of designated entities or other policy violations, such as incitement to violence.

Please see our [Corporate Human Rights Policy](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Facebooks-Corporate-Human-Rights-Policy.pdf) for more information about our commitment to internationally recognized human rights.

    * E.g. “I wish I can join ISIS and be part of the Khilafah”

We remove Glorification of Tier 1 and Tier 2 entities as well as designated events.

For Tier 1 and designated events, we may also remove unclear or contextless references if the user’s intent was not clearly indicated. This includes unclear humor, captionless or positive references that do not glorify the designated entity’s violence or hate.

**Support**, defined as any of the below:

* Material Support

    * E.g., “If you want to send care packages to the Sinaloa Cartel, use this address:”
* Recruiting on behalf of a designated entity or event;
    * E.g., “If you want to fight for the Caliphate, DM me”

* Other Support

* Channeling information or resources, including official communications, on behalf of a designated entity or event

* Putting out a call to action on behalf of a designated entity or event;

* E.g. "Contact the Atomwaffen Division – (XXX) XXX-XXXX"

We remove all Support of Tier 1 and Material Support of Tier 2.

**Representation**, defined as any of the below:

* Stating that you are a member of a designated entity, or are a designated entity;
    * E.g., “I am a grand dragon of the KKK.”
* Creating a Page, Profile, Event, Group, or other Facebook entity that is or purports to be owned by a Designated Entity or run on their behalf, or is or purports to be a designated event.
    * E.g., A Page named “American Nazi Party.”

We remove Representation of Tier 1 and 2 Designated Organizations and designated events.

Types and Tiers of Dangerous Organizations

We also don't allow other people to represent these entities. We do not allow leaders or prominent members of these organizations to have a presence on the platform, symbols that represent them to be used on the platform, or content that glorifies them or their acts, including unclear references to them. In addition, we remove any support for these individuals and organizations.

We do not allow content that glorifies, supports, or represents events that Meta designates as terrorist attacks, hate events, multiple-victim violence or attempted multiple-victim violence, serial murders, hate crimes or violating violent events. Nor do we allow (1) content that glorifies, supports, or represents the perpetrator(s) of such attacks; (2) perpetrator-generated content relating to such attacks; or (3) third-party imagery depicting the moment of such attacks on visible victims.

Any Individual who has committed such an attack is considered to be a perpetrator or an attempted perpetrator of multiple-victim violence.
* We consider any individual who has committed two or more murders over multiple incidents or locations a serial murderer.

**Hateful Ideologies**

* While our designations of organizations and individuals focus on behavior, we also recognize that there are certain ideologies and beliefs that are inherently tied to violence and attempts to organize people around calls for violence or exclusion of others based on their protected characteristics. In these cases, we designate the ideology itself and remove content that supports this ideology from our platform. These ideologies include:
    * Nazism

**_Tier 2: Violent Non-State Actors and Violence Inducing Entities_**

Organizations and individuals designated by Meta as Violent Non-state Actors or Violence Inducing Entities are not allowed to have a presence on our platforms, or have a presence maintained by others on their behalf. As these communities are actively engaged in violence, against state or military actors in armed conflicts (Violent Non-State Actors) or are preparing or advocating or creating conditions for future violence (Violence Inducing Entities), material support of these entities is not allowed. We will also remove glorification of these entities.

**Violent Non-State Actors**, defined as any non-state actor that:

Adult Sexual Solicitation and Sexually Explicit Language
========================================================

Policy Rationale

As noted in the [Adult Sexual Exploitation](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/sexual_exploitation_adults) policy, people use our services to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and exploitation. We recognize the importance of and allow for this discussion.We also allow for the discussion of sex worker rights advocacy and sex work regulation. We draw the line, however, when content facilitates sexual encounters or commercial sexual services between adults. We do this to avoid facilitating transactions that may involve trafficking, coercion and non-consensual sexual acts.

We also restrict sexually-explicit language that may lead to sexual solicitation because some audiences within our global community may be sensitive to this type of content, and it may impede the ability for people to connect with their friends and the broader community.

Child Sexual Exploitation, Abuse, and Nudity
============================================

Policy Rationale

We do not allow content or activity that sexually exploits or endangers children. When we become aware of apparent child exploitation, we report it to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), in compliance with applicable law. We know that sometimes people share nude images of their own children with good intentions; however, we generally remove these images because of the potential for abuse by others and to help avoid the possibility of other people reusing or misappropriating the images.

We also work with external experts, including the [Meta Safety Advisory Board](https://www.facebook.com/help/222332597793306?ref=ccs), to discuss and improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, especially with regard to children.

Adult Sexual Exploitation
=========================

Policy Rationale

We recognize the importance of our services as a place to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and exploitation. We believe this is an important part of building common understanding and community. In an effort to create space for this conversation and promote a safe environment, we allow survivors to share their experiences, but we remove content that depicts, threatens or promotes sexual violence, sexual assault or sexual exploitation. We also remove content that displays, advocates for or coordinates sexual acts with non-consenting parties to avoid facilitating non-consensual sexual acts. Further, if we become aware of any content that threatens or advocates rape, we may disable the posting account and work with law enforcement, in addition to removing the content.

To protect survivors, we remove images that depict incidents of sexual violence and intimate images shared without the consent of the person(s) pictured. As noted in the introduction, we also work with external safety experts to discuss and improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, and we may remove content when we receive information that content is linked to harmful activity. We have written about the [technology we use to protect against non-consensual intimate images](https://about.fb.com/news/2019/03/detecting-non-consensual-intimate-images/) and the [research that has informed our work](https://about.fb.com/news/2019/03/protecting-intimate-images/). We’ve also put together a [guide to reporting and removing intimate images shared without your consent](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/not-without-my-consent.pdf).

We may also enforce on content shared by a third party that identifies survivors of sexual assault when reported by an authorized representative or Trusted Partner.

Violence and Incitement
=======================

Policy Rationale

We aim to prevent potential offline violence that may be related to content on our platforms. While we understand that people commonly express disdain or disagreement by threatening or calling for violence in non-serious and casual ways, we remove language that incites or facilitates violence and credible threats to public or personal safety. This includes violent speech targeting a person or group of people on the basis of their protected characteristic(s) or immigration status. We remove content, disable accounts and work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm or direct threats to public safety. We also try to consider the language and context in order to distinguish casual or awareness-raising statements from content that constitutes a credible threat to public or personal safety. In determining whether a threat is credible, we may also consider additional information such as a person's public visibility and the risks to their physical safety.

In some cases, we see aspirational or conditional threats of violence, including expressions of hope that violence will be committed, directed at terrorists and other violent actors (e.g., “Terrorists deserve to be killed,” “I hope they kill the terrorists”). We deem those non-credible, absent specific evidence to the contrary.

We Remove:

We remove threats of violence against various targets. Threats of violence are statements or visuals representing an intention, aspiration, or call for violence against a target, and threats can be expressed in various types of statements such as statements of intent, calls for action, advocacy, expressions of hope, aspirational statements and conditional statements.  
  
**We do not prohibit threats when shared in awareness-raising or condemning context, when less severe threats are made in the context of contact sports, or certain threats against violent actors, like terrorist groups.**  
  
**Universal protections for everyone**  
Everyone is protected from the following threats:

* Threats of violence that could lead to death (or other forms of high-severity violence)
* Threats of violence that could lead to serious injury (mid-severity violence). We remove such threats against public figures and groups not based on protected characteristics when credible, and we remove them against any other targets (including groups based on protected characteristics) regardless of credibility
* Admissions to high-severity or mid-severity violence (in written or verbal form, or visually depicted by the perpetrator or an associate), except when shared in a context of redemption, self-defense, contact sports (mid-severity or less), or when committed by law enforcement, military or state security personnel
* Threats or depictions of kidnappings or abductions, unless it is clear that the content is being shared by a victim or their family as a plea for help, or shared for informational, condemnation or awareness-raising purposes

**Additional protections for Private Adults, All Children, high-risk persons and persons or groups based on their protected characteristics:**  
In addition to the universal protections for everyone, all private adults (when self-reported), children and persons or groups of people targeted on the basis of their protected characteristic(s), are protected from threats of low-severity violence.

**Other Violence**  
In addition to all of the protections listed above, we remove the following:

* Content that asks for, offers, or admits to offering services of high-severity violence (for example, hitmen, mercenaries, assassins, female genital mutilation) or advocates for the use of these services
* Instructions on how to make or use weapons where there is language explicitly stating the goal to seriously injure or kill people, or imagery that shows or simulates the end result, unless with context that the content is for a non-violent purpose such as educational self-defense (for example, combat training, martial arts) and military training
* Instructions on how to make or use explosives, unless with context that the content is for a non-violent purpose such as recreational uses (for example, fireworks and commercial video games, fishing)
* Threats to take up weapons or to bring weapons to a location or forcibly enter a location (including but not limited to places of worship, educational facilities, polling places or locations used to count votes or administer an election), or locations where there are temporary signals of a heightened risk of violence.
* Threats of violence related to voting, voter registration, or the administration or outcome of an election, even if there is no target.

Hate Speech
===========

Policy Rationale

We believe that people use their voice and connect more freely when they don’t feel attacked on the basis of who they are. That is why we don’t allow hate speech on Facebook, Instagram, or Threads. It creates an environment of intimidation and exclusion, and in some cases may promote offline violence.

We define hate speech as direct attacks against people — rather than concepts or institutions— on the basis of what we call protected characteristics (PCs): race, ethnicity, national origin, disability, religious affiliation, caste, sexual orientation, sex, gender identity, and serious disease. Additionally, we consider age a protected characteristic when referenced along with another protected characteristic. We also protect refugees, migrants, immigrants, and asylum seekers from the most severe attacks, though we do allow commentary on and criticism of immigration policies. Similarly, we provide some protections for non- protected characteristics, such as occupation, when they are referenced along with a protected characteristic. Sometimes, based on local nuance, we consider certain words or phrases as frequently used proxies for PC groups.

We define a hate speech attack as dehumanizing speech; statements of inferiority, expressions of contempt or disgust; cursing; and calls for exclusion or segregation. We also prohibit the use of harmful stereotypes, which we define as dehumanizing comparisons that have historically been used to attack, intimidate, or exclude specific groups, and that are often linked with offline violence. We also prohibit the usage of slurs that are used to attack people on the basis of their protected characteristics. Attacks are separated into two tiers of severity, described below.

We have additional restrictions for paid content.

However, we recognize that people sometimes share content that includes slurs or someone else’s hate speech in order to condemn the speech or report on it. In other cases, speech, including slurs, that might otherwise violate our standards is used self-referentially or in an empowering way. People also sometimes express contempt or curse at a gender in the context of a romantic break-up. Other times, they use gender-exclusive language to control membership in a health or positive support group, such as a breastfeeding group for women only. Our policies are designed to allow room for these types of speech but require people to clearly indicate their intent. Where intention is unclear, we may remove content.

Note: Violent speech targeting people on the basis of their protected characteristics is covered in our Violence and Incitement Policy.

Do not post:

**Tier 1**

* Content attacking concepts, institutions, ideas, practices, or beliefs associated with protected characteristics, which are likely to contribute to imminent physical harm, intimidation or discrimination against the people associated with that protected characteristic. Meta looks at a range of signs to determine whether there is a threat of harm in the content. These include but are not limited to: content that could incite imminent violence or intimidation; whether there is a period of heightened tension such as an election or ongoing conflict; and whether there is a recent history of violence against the targeted protected group. In some cases, we may also consider whether the speaker is a public figure or occupies a position of authority.

Bullying and Harassment
=======================

Policy Rationale

Bullying and harassment happen in many places and come in many different forms from making threats and releasing personally identifiable information to sending threatening messages and making unwanted malicious contact. We do not tolerate this kind of behavior because it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on Facebook, Instagram, and Threads.

We distinguish between public figures and private individuals because we want to allow discussion, which often includes critical commentary of people who are featured in the news or who have a large public audience. For public figures, we remove attacks that are severe as well as certain attacks where the public figure is directly tagged in the post or comment. We define public figures as state and national level government officials, political candidates for those offices, people with over one million fans or followers on social media and people who receive substantial news coverage.

For private individuals, our protection goes further: We remove content that's meant to degrade or shame, including, for example, claims about someone's sexual activity. We recognize that bullying and harassment can have more of an emotional impact on minors, which is why our policies provide heightened protection for anyone under the age 18, regardless of user status.

Context and intent matter, and we allow people to post and share if it is clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to bullying and harassment. In certain instances, we require self-reporting because it helps us understand that the person targeted feels bullied or harassed. In addition to reporting such behavior and content, we encourage people to use [tools available on our platforms](https://www.facebook.com/safety/tools) to help protect against it.

We also have a [Bullying Prevention Hub](https://www.facebook.com/safety/bullying), which is a resource for teens, parents, and educators seeking support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers step-by-step guidance, including information on how to start important conversations about bullying. Learn more about what we are doing to protect people from bullying and harassment [here](https://about.fb.com/news/2018/10/protecting-people-from-bullying/).

Suicide, Self-Injury, and Eating Disorders
==========================================

Policy Rationale

We care deeply about the safety of the people who use our apps. We regularly consult with experts in suicide, self-injury and eating disorders to help inform our policies and enforcement, and we work with organizations around the world to provide assistance to people in distress.

While we do not allow people to intentionally or unintentionally celebrate or promote suicide, self-injury or eating disorders, we do allow people to discuss these topics because we want our services to be a space where people can share their experiences, raise awareness about these issues, and seek support from one another.

We remove any content that encourages suicide, self-injury or eating disorders, including fictional content such as memes or illustrations, and any self-injury content which is graphic, regardless of context. We also remove content that mocks victims or survivors of suicide, self-injury or eating disorders, as well as real time depictions of suicide or self-injury. Content about recovery from suicide, self-injury or eating disorders that is allowed, but may contain imagery that could be upsetting (such as a healed scar) is placed behind a sensitivity screen.

When people post or search for suicide, self-injury or eating disorders related content, we will direct them to local organizations that can provide support and if our Community Operations team is concerned about immediate harm we will contact local emergency services to get them help. For more information, visit the [Meta Safety Center.](https://www.facebook.com/safety/wellbeing/suicideprevention)

With respect to live content, experts have told us that if someone is saying they intend to attempt suicide on a livestream, we should leave the content up for as long as possible because the longer someone is talking to a camera, the more opportunity there is for a friend or family member to call emergency services.However, to minimize the risk of others being negatively impacted by viewing this content, we will stop the livestream at the point at which the threat turns into an attempt. As mentioned above, in any case, we will contact emergency services if we identify someone is at immediate risk of harming themselves.

Do not post:

Content that promotes, encourages, coordinates, or provides instructions for suicide, self-injury, or eating disorders.

* Content that depicts graphic suicide, self-injury, and eating disorder imagery
* Content depicting a person who engaged in a suicide attempt or death by suicide
* Content that focuses on depiction of ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave stomach, or protruding spine or scapula when shared together with terms associated with eating disorders
* Content that contains instructions for drastic and unhealthy weight loss when shared together with terms associated with eating disorders
* Content that mocks victims or survivors of suicide, self-injury or eating disorders who are either publicly known or implied to have experienced suicide or self-injury
* Imagery depicting body modification (e.g., tattoo, piercing, scarification, self-flagellation, etc.) when shared in a suicide or self-injury context

For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the content may be sensitive. We also limit the ability to view the content to adults, ages 18 and older:

* Photos or videos depicting a person who engaged in euthanasia/assisted suicide in a medical setting.

For the following content, we include a label so that people are aware the content may be sensitive:

* Content that depicts older instances of self-harm such as healed cuts or other non-graphic self-injury imagery in a self-injury, suicide or recovery context.
* Content that depicts ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave stomach, or protruding spine or scapula in a recovery context.

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yh/r/3yRrWspEQ3r.png)

We provide resources to people who post written or verbal admissions of engagement in self injury, including:

* Suicide.
* Euthanasia/assisted suicide.
* Self-harm.
* Eating disorders.
* Vague, potentially suicidal statements or references (including memes or stock imagery about sad mood or depression) in a suicide or self-injury context.

For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or context to enforce:

* We may remove suicide notes when we have confirmation of a suicide or suicide attempt. We try to identify suicide notes using several factors, including but not limited to:
    * Family or legal representative requests,
    * Reports from media, law enforcement, or other third party sources (e.g. government agencies, NGOs), or the [Suicidal Content Contact Form](https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/305410456169423/) or [Instagram Contact Form](https://help.instagram.com/contact/383679321740945/).

Violent and Graphic Content
===========================

Policy Rationale

We understand that people have different sensitivities with regard to graphic and violent imagery. To protect users from such content, we remove the most graphic content and add warning labels to other graphic content so that people are aware it may be sensitive or disturbing before they click through. We may also restrict the ability for users under 18 to view such content (or “age-gate” the content).

We recognize that users may share content in order to shed light on or condemn acts such as human rights abuses or armed conflict. Our policies consider when content shared in this context and allow room for discussion and awareness raising accordingly.

In ads, we provide additional protections. For example, content that has been deemed sensitive or disturbing is not eligible to run in ads. We also prohibit ads from including images and videos that are shocking, gruesome, or otherwise sensational.

Do not post:

**Imagery of people**

Videos of people, living or deceased, in non-medical contexts, depicting:

* Dismemberment.
* Visible innards, such as exposed organs, bones, or muscle tissue on living or deceased persons;
* Burning or charred persons; or
* Throat-slitting.

Sadistic remarks are commentary – such as captions or comments – expressing joy or pleasure from the suffering or humiliation of people or animals.

We remove

* Sadistic remarks made toward imagery (both videos and still images) that otherwise receives a warning screen under this policy, advising people that the content may be disturbing; unless the imagery depicts acts of self-defense (e.g., video of someone defending themselves from armed robbery) or is in a medical context (e.g., an image of medical professionals performing surgery).
* Sadistic remarks made towards the following imagery that otherwise receives a warning screen under this policy advising people it may be sensitive:
    * Imagery depicting a person’s violent death or life threatening event when the act of violence is committed by uniformed personnel performing a police function;

    * Imagery depicting fetuses and babies outside of the womb that are deceased;
* Explicit sadistic remarks made towards the suffering of animals depicted in imagery, and imagery depicting animals going from live to dead.
* Offering or soliciting imagery that is deleted or receives a warning screen under this policy, when accompanied by sadistic remarks.

For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the content may be disturbing. We also limit the ability to view the content to adults, ages 18 and older:
