Community Standards
===================

The Community Standards outline what is and isn't allowed on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and Threads.

### Introduction

Every day, people use Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and Threads to share their experiences, connect with friends and family, and build communities. Our services enable billions of people to freely express themselves across countries and cultures and in dozens of languages.

Meta recognizes how important it is for Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and Threads to be places where people feel empowered to communicate, and we take our role seriously in keeping abuse off the service. That’s why we developed standards for what is and isn’t allowed on these services.

These standards are based on feedback from people and the advice of experts in fields like technology, public safety and human rights. To ensure everyone’s voice is valued, we take great care to create standards that include different views and beliefs, especially from people and communities that might otherwise be overlooked or marginalized.

  

**Please note that the US English version of the Community Standards reflects the most up to date set of the policies and should be used as the primary document.**

### Our commitment to voice

The goal of our Community Standards is to create a place for expression and give people a voice. Meta wants people to be able to talk openly about the issues that matter to them, whether through written comments, photos, music, or other artistic mediums, even if some may disagree or find them objectionable. In some cases, we allow content—which would otherwise go against our standards—if it’s [newsworthy](https://transparency.meta.com/features/approach-to-newsworthy-content) and in the public interest. We do this only after weighing the public interest value against the risk of harm, and we look to international human rights standards to make these judgments. In other cases, we may remove content that uses ambiguous or implicit language when additional context allows us to reasonably understand that the content goes against our standards.

Our commitment to expression is paramount, but we recognize the internet creates new and increased opportunities for abuse. For these reasons, when we limit expression, we do it in service of one or more of the following values:

AUTHENTICITY
------------

We want to make sure the content people see is authentic. We believe that authenticity creates a better environment for sharing, and that’s why we don’t want people using our services to misrepresent who they are or what they’re doing.

SAFETY
------

We’re committed to making Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and Threads safe places. We remove content that could contribute to a risk of harm to the physical security of persons. Content that threatens people has the potential to intimidate, exclude or silence others and isn’t allowed on our services.

PRIVACY
-------

We’re committed to protecting personal privacy and information. Privacy gives people the freedom to be themselves, choose how and when to share on our services and connect more easily.

DIGNITY
-------

We believe that all people are equal in dignity and rights. We expect that people will respect the dignity of others and not harass or degrade others.

### Community Standards

Our Community Standards apply to everyone, all around the world, and to all types of content, including AI-generated content.

Each section of our Community Standards starts with a “Policy Rationale” that sets out the aims of the policy followed by specific policy lines that outline:

Content that's not allowed; and

Content that requires additional information or context to enforce on, content that is allowed with a warning screen or content that is allowed but can only be viewed by adults aged 18 and older.

Adult Nudity and Sexual Activity
================================

Policy Rationale

We restrict the display of nudity or sexual activity because some people in our community may be sensitive to this type of content, particularly due to cultural background or age.

We understand that nudity can be shared for a variety of reasons, including as a form of protest, to raise awareness about a cause or for educational or medical reasons. Where appropriate and such intent is clear, we make allowances for the content. For example, while we restrict some images of female breasts that include the nipple, we allow other images, including those depicting acts of protest, women actively engaged in breast-feeding and photos of post-mastectomy scarring (sometimes labeled with a sensitive warning screen and age-based restrictions). We also allow real world art that depicts nudity such as photographs of paintings, sculptures, etc (sometimes labeled with a sensitive warning screen and age-based restrictions). We default to removing sexual imagery to prevent the sharing of non-consensual or underage content.

Under this policy, we remove real photographs and videos of nudity and sexual activity, AI- or computer-generated images of nudity and sexual activity, and digital imagery, regardless of whether it looks “photorealistic” (as in, it looks like a real person). As noted above, we also make careful allowances for real world art and certain medical, educational, and awareness-raising content, and these are detailed in the policy.

Content relating to child nudity is addressed in our Community Standard on [Child Sexual Exploitation, Abuse and Nudity](https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/child-sexual-exploitation-abuse-nudity/).

    *   Visible female nipples, except in a breastfeeding, or act of protest context
    
    *   Photorealistic/ digital videos that focus on crotch, female breasts, or buttocks recorded without the awareness of the person(s) depicted in them

Child Sexual Exploitation, Abuse, and Nudity
============================================

Policy Rationale

We do not allow content or activity that sexually exploits or endangers children. When we become aware of apparent child exploitation, we report it to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), in compliance with applicable law. We know that sometimes people share nude images of their own children with good intentions; however, we generally remove these images because of the potential for abuse by others and to help avoid the possibility of other people reusing or misappropriating the images.

We also work with external experts, including the [Meta Safety Advisory Board](https://www.facebook.com/help/222332597793306?ref=ccs), to discuss and improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, especially with regard to children. Learn more about the [technology we’re using to fight against child exploitation](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/10/fighting-child-exploitation/).

Do not post:

This includes but is not limited to:

*   Sexual intercourse
    *   Explicit sexual intercourse or oral sex, defined as mouth or genitals entering or in contact with another person's genitals or anus, when at least one person's genitals or anus is visible.

    *   Stimulation of genitals or anus, including when activity is imminent or not directly visible.
    *   Any of the above involving an animal.

    *   Sexualized costume
    *   Stripping
    *   Staged environment (for example, on a bed) or professionally shot (quality/focus/angles)

Content that praises, supports, promotes, advocates for, provides instructions for or encourages participation in non-sexual child abuse

In addition to removing accounts that violate our Child Sexual Exploitation, Abuse and Nudity (CSEAN) policies, our reviewers and automated systems consider a broad spectrum of signals to help prevent potentially unwanted or unsafe interactions.

*   We may disable accounts or restrict access to products and features (e.g. the ability to follow certain accounts) for adults based on their interactions with other accounts, searches for or interactions with violating content (e.g. liking or saving), or membership in communities (e.g. Groups) we have removed for violating our policies.

For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the content may be disturbing and limit the ability to view the content to adults ages eighteen and older:

*   Videos or photos that depict police officers or military personnel committing non-sexual child abuse
*   Videos or photos of non-sexual child abuse, when law enforcement, child protection agencies, or trusted safety partners request that we leave the content on the platform for the express purpose of bringing a child back to safety

For the following content, we include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware the content may be upsetting to some:

*   Videos or photos of violent immersion of a child in water in the context of religious rituals

For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or context to enforce:

For the following content, we include a warning label so that people are aware that the content may be sensitive:

We may remove imagery depicting the aftermath of non-sexual child abuse when reported by news media partners, NGOs, or other trusted safety partners.

We may remove content that identifies alleged victims of child sexual exploitation through means other than name or image if content includes information that is likely to lead to the identification of the individual.

We may remove content created for the purpose of identifying a private minor if there is a risk to the minor’s safety, when requested by Law Enforcement, Government, Trusted Partner, or the content is self-reported by the minor or the minor’s parent/legal guardian

Spam
====

Policy Rationale

We do not allow content that is designed to deceive, mislead, or overwhelm users in order to artificially increase viewership. This content detracts from people's ability to engage authentically on our platforms and can threaten the security, stability and usability of our services. We also seek to prevent abusive tactics, such as spreading deceptive links to draw unsuspecting users in through misleading functionality or code, or impersonating a trusted domain.

Online spam is a lucrative industry. Our policies and detection must constantly evolve to keep up with emerging spam trends and tactics. In taking action to combat spam, we seek to balance raising the costs for its producers and distributors on our platforms, with protecting the vibrant, authentic activity of our community.

We do not allow:

*   Posting, sharing, engaging with content or creating accounts, Groups, Pages, Events or other assets, either manually or automatically, at very high frequencies.
    *   We may place restrictions on accounts that are acting at lower frequencies when other indicators of Spam (e.g., posting repetitive content) or signals of inauthenticity are present.

*   Attempting to or successfully selling, buying, or exchanging platform assets, such as accounts, groups, pages, etc.
*   Attempting to or successfully selling, buying, or exchanging site privileges, such as admin or moderator roles, or permission to post in specific spaces.
*   Attempting to or successfully selling, buying, or exchanging content for something of monetary value, except clearly identified Branded Content, as defined by our [Branded Content Policy](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/221149188908254).
*   Attempting to or successfully selling, buying, or exchanging for engagement, such as likes, shares, views, follows, clicks, use of specific hashtags, etc. This includes:
    *   Offering giveaways (i.e., offering others a chance to win) of cash or cash equivalents in exchange for engagement. (e.g., “Anyone that likes my page will be entered to win $500”)
    *   Offering to provide anything of monetary value in exchange for engagement. (e.g., “If you like my page, I will give you an iPhone!”)

*   Requiring or claiming that users are required to engage with content (e.g., liking, sharing) before they are able to view or interact with promised content.
*   Sharing deceptive or misleading URLs, domains, or applications including:
    *   **[Cloaking](https://about.fb.com/news/2017/08/news-feed-fyi-addressing-cloaking-so-people-see-more-authentic-posts/)**: Cloaking is any attempt to circumvent our content policies by intentionally presenting different off-platform content, such as URLs or applications, to our integrity systems versus what is shown to users.
    *   **Misleading Links**: Content containing a link that promises one type of content but delivers something substantially different.This can include content in a promised app or software.
    *   **Deceptive redirect behavior**: Websites that require an action (e.g. captcha, watch ad, click here) in order to view the expected landing page content and the domain name of the URL changes after the required action is complete, or automatically redirects users to a substantially different domain without any user action.
    *   **Like/share-gating**: Requiring users to engage (in the form of likes, shares, follows, or any other public-facing form of engagement) to gain access to specific, exclusive content.
    *   **Deceptive platform functionality** - Mimicking the features or functionality of our services, such as mimicking fundraising, in-line polls, play buttons, or the Like button where that functionality does not exist or does not function as expected, in order to get a user to follow a link.
    *   **Deceptive landing page functionality**: Websites that have a misleading user interface, which results in accidental traffic being generated (e.g. pop-ups/unders, clickjacking, etc.).This includes tactics like trapping, where irrelevant pop-ups appear when a person attempts to leave the landing page.
    *   **Landing page or domain impersonation** - An off-platform landing page, URL, or external website or domain that pretends to be a reputable brand or service by using a name, domain or content that features typos, misspellings or other means to impersonate well-known websites, domains or brands using a landing page similar to another, trusted site.
    *   Other deceptive uses of URLs or links that are substantially similar to the above.

*   Notwithstanding the above, we do not prohibit:
    *   Cross promotion that is not triggered by payment to a third party
    *   Transferring admin or moderation responsibilities for a page or group to another user based on their interest in the page or group, rather than an exchange of value.
    *   Posting or sharing clearly identified Branded Content.

Fraud, Scams, and Deceptive Practices
=====================================

Policy Rationale

We aim to protect users and businesses from being deceived out of their money, property or personal information. We achieve this by removing content and combatting behavior that purposefully employs deceptive means - such as wilful misrepresentation, stolen information and exaggerated claims - to either scam or defraud users and businesses, or to drive engagement. This includes content that seeks to coordinate or promote those activities using our services. We allow people to raise awareness and educate others as well as condemn these activities.

We do not allow:

Content that attempts to scam or defraud users and/or businesses by means of:

**Loan Fraud and Scams**

Content that:

*   Offers loans requiring the user to pay an advance fee to obtain a loan.
*   Offers loans with guarantee or near-guarantee of approval, either explicitly stated or implicitly understood based on context (such as claims to approve loan without asking for financial information).
*   Note: We also look for other signals to determine if an entity is posting legitimate, non-fraudulent content, such as when it is a verified entity and a bank or financial institution.

**Gambling Fraud and Scams**

Content that:

*   Offers real money gambling services (“Real money” is real-world currency that can be used to buy goods or services in the real world, including national currencies such as U.S. Dollars and virtual currencies such as Bitcoin):
    *   with a guarantee of winning.
    *   implying or admitting to have rigged the outcome of a game or match.
    *   soliciting people to enable match fixing or looking for help or tips on how to fix a match or game.

Social casino games that simulate gambling with no opportunity to win real money fall under our [Community Standard for Restricted Goods and Services](https://transparency.meta.com/policies/community-standards/regulated-goods/).

**Investment or Financial Fraud and Scams**

*   _Investment Opportunities._ Content that:
    *   Offers investment opportunities where returns on investment are guaranteed or risk-free.
    *   Offers investment opportunities where returns on investment or compensation is partly or fully based on recruitment of others to participate in the scheme.
    *   Offers investment opportunities where the opportunity is of a “get-rich-quick” nature and/or claims that a small investment can be turned into a large amount.

*   _Money/Cash Flip._ Content that:
    *   Offers to turn a certain sum of money into a larger one through flipping or trick or strategy involving explicit mentions of ”cash flip,” "money flip,” or similar terminology.

**Money Muling and Laundering Fraud and Scams**

*   _Money Muling._ Content that:
    *   Offers or asks for money muling (causing victims to be unknowing participants in money laundering by offering money or share of profits in exchange for allowing others to use their bank accounts or transferring money on behalf of others).
    *   Offers or asks for money muling by offering employment to accept and transfer money to third parties using the victim’s bank account.

*   _Money Laundering._ Content that:
    *   Requests, solicits, or offers to facilitate money laundering, which is an attempt to make illegally obtained money appear legitimate by disguising the origin of the money through a complex sequence of financial transactions, including through any of the following means:
        *   Seeking transfer of funds through SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications) or similar methods,
        *   Seeking or offering details on types of bank accounts available to support receipt or transfer of cash.

**Inauthentic Identity Fraud and Scams**

Content that:

*   Attempts to scam or defraud users by misrepresenting the identity of the poster or nature of a request:
    *   Charity Fraud and Scam, which are fraudulent requests for money or donations for charitable causes together with claims that the donation is urgent and includes information, such as bank accounts, where money can be sent.
    *   Romance Fraud and Scam, which are fraudulent attempts to establish online romantic relationships by seeking non-sexual companionship or relationship and offering or asking for money or its equivalent in exchange.
    *   Established Business/Entity Fraud and Scams, which involve falsely claiming to represent, or speak in the voice of, an established business or entity, in an attempt to scam or defraud.

**Product or Reward Fraud and Scams**

*   _Government Grant Fraud and Scam._ Content that:
    *   Falsely offers money from government grants or any other governmental source of funding. We consider various signals to determine if an entity is posting legitimate, non-fraudulent content, such as when it comes from a verified entity.

*   _Tangible, Spiritual or Illuminati Fraud and Scam._ Content that:
    *   Offers tangible rewards, such as money, goods, or services that have a monetary value including physical, digital and virtual currencies, and physical or digital goods and services for membership in or joining an association, cult, religious sect (for example, the Illuminati brotherhood).
    *   Offers tangible rewards for using black magic or spells or magical items (for example, spells, lucky charms, amulets, tokens, potions, magic wallet, etc.).

*   _Insurance Fraud and Scams._ Content that:
    *   Offers false, heavily discounted insurance with requests for an up-front fee (admin fee, or deposit, or otherwise).
    *   Offers false, heavily discounted insurance with promises of large savings on insurance compared to conventional insurance providers (at least 30% less).
    *   Note: We also look for other signals to determine if an entity is posting legitimate, non-fraudulent content, such as when it is a verified entity and a bank or financial institution

*   _Job Fraud and Scams._ Content that:
    *   Offers jobs with an unclear or vague job description and get-rich-quick opportunities promising money with little time investment or effort.
    *   Offers jobs containing no job information, simply referencing job vacancies.
    *   Offers work from home but the job title implies the employee cannot WFH.
    *   Offers jobs with advance promises of salary.
    *   Offers guaranteed jobs.
    *   Offers jobs with a demand for an advance fee before the job is granted.
    *   Note: We also look for other signals to determine if an entity is posting legitimate, non-fraudulent content, such as when it is a verified entity

*   _Debt Relief and Credit Repair Fraud and Scam._ Content that:
    *   Promises to delete or eliminate or reduce debt by a particular amount in a set period of time.

Account Integrity
=================

Policy Rationale

In order to maintain a safe environment and empower free expression, we restrict or remove accounts that are harmful to the community. We have built a combination of automated and manual systems to restrict and remove accounts that are used to egregiously or persistently violate our policies across any of our products.

Because account removal is a serious action, whenever possible, we aim to give our community opportunities to learn our rules and follow our Community Standards. For example, a notification is issued each time we remove content, and in most cases we also provide people with information about the nature of the violation and any restrictions that are applied. Our enforcement actions are designed to be proportional to the severity of the violation, the history of violations on the account, and the risk or harm posed to the community. Continued violations, despite repeated warnings and restrictions, or violations that pose severe safety risks will lead to an account being disabled.

Learn more about how Meta enforces its policies and restricts accounts in the [Transparency Center](https://transparency.fb.com/en-gb/enforcement/taking-action/restricting-accounts/).

We may restrict or disable accounts, other entities (Pages, groups, events) or business assets (Business Managers, ad accounts) that:

*   Violate our Community Standards involving egregious harms, including those we refer to law enforcement due to the risk of imminent harm to individual or public safety
*   Violate our Community Standards involving any harms that warrant referral to law enforcement due to the risk of imminent harm to individual of public safety
*   Violate our Advertising Standards involving deceptive or dangerous business harms
*   Persistently violate our Community Standards by posting violating content and/or managing violating entities or business assets
*   Persistently violate our Advertising Standards
*   Demonstrate activity or behavior indicative of a clear violating purpose

We may restrict or disable accounts, other entities (Pages, groups, events) or business assets (Business Managers, ad accounts) that are:

*   Owned by the same person or entity as an account that has been disabled
*   Created or repurposed to evade a previous account or entity removal, including those assessed to have common ownership and content as previously removed accounts or entities
*   Created to contact a user that has blocked an account
*   Otherwise used to evade our enforcement actions or review processes

We may restrict or disable accounts, other entities (Pages, groups, events) or business assets (Business Managers, ad accounts) that demonstrate:

*   Close linkage with a network of accounts or other entities that violate or evade our policies
*   Coordination within a network of accounts or other entities that persistently or egregiously violate our policies
*   Activity or behavior indicative of a clear violating purpose through a network of accounts

We will work to restrict or disable accounts or other entities (Pages, groups, events), or business assets (Business Managers, ad accounts) that engage in off-platform activity that can lead to harm on our platform, including those:

*   Owned by a convicted sex offender, convicted of offences related to the sexual abuse of children or adults
*   Owned by a Designated Entity or run on their behalf
*   Prohibited from receiving our products, services or software under applicable laws

In the following scenarios, we may request additional information about an account to ascertain ownership and/or permissible activity:

*   Compromised accounts
*   Creating or using an account or other entity through automated means, such as scripting (unless the scripting activity occurs through authorized routes and does not otherwise violate our policies)
*   Empty accounts with prolonged dormancy

Authentic Identity Representation
=================================

Policy Rationale

Authenticity is the cornerstone of our community. We believe that authenticity helps create a community where people are accountable to each other, and to Meta, in meaningful ways. We want to allow for the many ways that identity is expressed across our global community, while preventing impersonation and identity misrepresentation. To maintain a safe and open environment where people can trust one another and build community, we do not allow for the creation of accounts or profiles that are created or used to deceive others.

On Facebook, we require people to create one account using the name they go by in everyday life that represents their authentic identity. We created [Additional Profiles](https://www.facebook.com/help/967154637433480) to help people express different parts of their identity, such as their interests or businesses.

We do not allow the use of our services and will restrict or disable Facebook, Instagram, and Threads accounts or other Facebook entities (such as Pages, groups) that:

*   Belong to underage children
*   Impersonate another person or entity by:
    *   Using their image(s), name, or likeness with the aim to deceive others
    *   Speaking in the voice of another person or entity for whom the user is not authorized to do so (e.g. by creating a Page or Profile)
*   Engage in identity misrepresentation to mislead or deceive others, evade enforcement, or violate our Community Standards. We consider a number of factors when assessing misleading identity misrepresentation, such as:
    *   Repeated or significant changes to identity details, such as name or age
    *   Misleading profile information, such as bio details and profile location
    *   Using stock imagery
*   Use a name containing violations of our Community Standards.

On Facebook, we will seek further information before taking actions ranging from temporarily restricting to permanently disabling profiles or accounts if you:

*   Provide a false date of birth
*   Use a name that is not the authentic name you go by in everyday life
*   Create a single account that represents or is used by more than one person
*   Create or maintain multiple Facebook accounts
*   Create an account that represents a non-human entity, such as a business, pet, or fictional character
*   Maintain empty profiles with prolonged dormancy

Inauthentic Behavior
====================

Policy Rationale

In line with our commitment to authenticity, we don't allow people to misrepresent themselves on our services, use fake accounts, artificially boost the popularity of content, or engage in behaviors designed to enable other violations under our Community Standards. Inauthentic Behavior refers to a variety of complex forms of deception, performed by a network of inauthentic assets controlled by the same individual or individuals, with the goal of deceiving Meta or our community or to evade enforcement under the Community Standards.

Where adversarial threat actors use fake accounts to engage in sophisticated Inauthentic tactics in order to influence public debate - they engage in what we’ve defined as Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior - or coordinated efforts to manipulate public debate for a strategic goal, in which fake accounts are central to the operation. This violating behavior receives a more severe and often bespoke response, in keeping with their more substantial and sophisticated efforts to deceive. Whenever possible, we share our findings about networks of Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior in our Quarterly Adversarial Threat Reports, found [here](https://transparency.fb.com/en-gb/metasecurity/threat-reporting). These reports are not meant to cover the entire universe of enforcements under the Inauthentic Behavior policy, but help inform our community’s understanding of the evolving nature of threats we face in this space.

While Inauthentic Behavior is often associated with civic or political content, and we are committed to preventing Inauthentic Behavior in the context of elections - these enforcement actions and standards apply agnostic of content, political or otherwise. This policy is intended to protect the authenticity of debate and discussion on our services, and create a space where people can trust the people and communities they interact with.

We do not allow:

*   The creation, use, or claimed use of Inauthentic Meta Assets (Accounts, Pages, Groups, etc.) in order to:
    
    *   Deceive Meta or our users about:
    
    *   The identity, purpose, or origin of an audience or the entity that they represent; or
    *   the popularity of content or assets on our services; or
    *   a Meta asset’s ownership or control network.
    
    *   To Evade enforcement under the Community Standards.
    *   Misuse Meta reporting systems to harass, intimidate or silence others.

*   Engaging in complex deception through the use of Meta Assets, including:
    *   **Inauthentic Distribution:** Using a connected network of inauthentic Meta assets to increase the distribution of content, in order to mislead Meta or its users about the popularity of the content in question.
    *   **Inauthentic Audience Building:** Using inauthentic Meta assets to increase the viewership or following of network assets, in order to mislead Meta or its users about the origin, ownership or purpose of an asset or assets.
    *   **Foreign Inauthentic Behavior:** Foreign entities using Inauthentic Meta assets to falsely represent a domestic or local voice, in order to deceive an audience about the identity, purpose or origin of the entity they represent.
    *   **Inauthentic Engagement:** Using a connected network of inauthentic Meta assets to deliver substantial quantities of fake engagement in ways designed to look authentic, in order to deceive Meta and its users about the popularity of content.
    *   **Substantially Similar Deceptions:** Other substantially similar claimed or actual efforts by relatively sophisticated, connected networks of inauthentic Meta assets to deceive Meta or its users about the origin, popularity, or purpose of content.

For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or context to enforce:

We do not allow:

*   Entities to engage in, or claim to engage in **Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior**, defined as particularly sophisticated forms of Inauthentic Behavior where inauthentic accounts are central to the operation and operators:
    *   Use adversarial methods to evade detection or appear authentic; and
    *   Use a variety of adversarial and inauthentic techniques to achieve overarching strategic objectives; and
    *   Primarily seek to manipulate public debate.

*   Entities to engage in, or claim to engage in **Foreign Interference**, defined as Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior where the network operators are not located in the same country as the audience the operation targets.
*   Entities to engage in, or claim to engage in **Government Interference**, defined as Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior where the operation is attributable to a government actor.
*   Governments that have instituted sustained blocks of social media to use their official departments, agencies, and embassies to deny the use of force or violent events in the context of an attack against the territorial integrity of another state in violation of Article 2(4) of the UN charter.

Dangerous Organizations and Individuals
=======================================

Policy Rationale

In an effort to prevent and disrupt real-world harm, we do not allow organizations or individuals that proclaim a violent mission or are engaged in violence to have a presence on our platforms. We assess these entities based on their behavior both online and offline, most significantly, their ties to violence. Under this policy, we designate individuals, organizations, and networks of people. These designations are divided into two tiers that indicate the level of content enforcement, with Tier 1 resulting in the most extensive enforcement because we believe these entities have the most direct ties to offline harm.

**Tier 1** focuses on entities that engage in serious offline harms - including organizing or advocating for violence against civilians, repeatedly dehumanizing or advocating for harm against people based on protected characteristics, or engaging in systematic criminal operations. Tier 1 includes hate organizations; criminal organizations, including those designated by the United States government as Specially Designated Narcotics Trafficking Kingpins (SDNTKs); and terrorist organizations, including entities and individuals designated by the United States government as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) or Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs). We remove Glorification, Support, and Representation of Tier 1 entities, their leaders, founders or prominent members, as well as unclear references to them.

In addition, we do not allow content that glorifies, supports, or represents events that Meta designates as violating violent events - including terrorist attacks, hate events, multiple-victim violence or attempted multiple-victim violence, serial murders, or hate crimes. Nor do we allow (1) Glorification, Support, or Representation of the perpetrator(s) of such attacks; (2) perpetrator-generated content relating to such attacks; or (3) third-party imagery depicting the moment of such attacks on visible victims. We also remove content that Glorifies, Supports or Represents ideologies that promote hate, such as nazism and white supremacy.We remove unclear references to these designated events or ideologies.

**Tier 2** includes Violent Non-State Actors that engage in violence against state or military actors in an armed conflict but do not intentionally target civilians. It also includes Violence Inducing Entities that are engaged in preparing or advocating for future violence but have not necessarily engaged in violence to date. These are also entities that may repeatedly engage in violations of our Hate Speech or Dangerous Organizations and Individuals policies on or off the platform. We remove Glorification, Material Support, and Representation of these entities, their leaders, founders or prominent members.

We recognize that users may share content that includes references to designated dangerous organizations and individuals in the context of social and political discourse. This includes content reporting on, neutrally discussing or condemning dangerous organizations and individuals or their activities.

News reporting includes information that is shared to raise awareness about local and global events in which designated dangerous organizations and individuals are involved.

*   E.g. “Breaking News: Al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the attack in Somalia”
*   E.g. “Timeline and expert analysis: How the shooting at the Buffalo Supermarket unfolded and what did the perpetrator say in court”

Neutral discussion includes factual statements, commentary, questions, and other information that do not express positive judgment around the designated dangerous organization or individual and their behavior.

*   E.g. “Al Qaeda represents less threat than ISIS given the lack of leadership and finance”
*   E.g. “Anders Breivik is one example of how complex the radicalization process can be”

Condemnation includes disapproval, disgust, rejection, criticism, mockery, and other negative expressions about a designated dangerous organization or individual and their behavior.

*   E.g. “I feel disgusted by the crime of Salvador Ramos. The judge’s words resonated so much to me. He should get no mercy by the court”
*   E.g. “Hitler’s crimes shall never be forgotten ever. These were some of the darkest moments in history”

Our policies are designed to allow room for these types of discussions while simultaneously limiting risks of potential offline harm. We thus require people to clearly indicate their intent when creating or sharing such content. If a user's intention is ambiguous or unclear, we default to removing content.

In line with international human rights law, our policies allow discussions about the human rights of designated individuals or members of designated dangerous entities, unless the content includes other glorification, support, or representation of designated entities or other policy violations, such as incitement to violence.

Please see our [Corporate Human Rights Policy](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Facebooks-Corporate-Human-Rights-Policy.pdf) for more information about our commitment to internationally recognized human rights.

We Remove:

    *   E.g. “I wish I can join ISIS and be part of the Khilafah”

We remove Glorification of Tier 1 and Tier 2 entities as well as designated events.

For Tier 1 and designated events, we may also remove unclear or contextless references if the user’s intent was not clearly indicated. This includes unclear humor, captionless or positive references that do not glorify the designated entity’s violence or hate.

**Support**, defined as any of the below:

*   Material Support

*   Any act which improves the financial status of a designated entity – including funneling money towards or away from a designated entity;
    *   E.g., “Donate to the KKK!”

    *   E.g., “If you want to send care packages to the Sinaloa Cartel, use this address:”
*   Recruiting on behalf of a designated entity or event;
    *   E.g., “If you want to fight for the Caliphate, DM me”

*   Other Support

*   Channeling information or resources, including official communications, on behalf of a designated entity or event

*   E.g., Directly quoting a designated entity without caption that condemns, neutrally discusses, or is a part of news reporting.

*   Putting out a call to action on behalf of a designated entity or event;

*   E.g. "Contact the Atomwaffen Division – (XXX) XXX-XXXX"

We remove all Support of Tier 1 and Material Support of Tier 2.

**Representation**, defined as any of the below:

*   Stating that you are a member of a designated entity, or are a designated entity;
    *   E.g., “I am a grand dragon of the KKK.”
*   Creating a Page, Profile, Event, Group, or other Facebook entity that is or purports to be owned by a Designated Entity or run on their behalf, or is or purports to be a designated event.
    *   E.g., A Page named “American Nazi Party.”

We remove Representation of Tier 1 and 2 Designated Organizations and designated events.

Types and Tiers of Dangerous Organizations

**_Tier 1: Terrorism, organized hate, large-scale criminal activity, attempted multiple-victim violence, multiple victim violence, serial murders, and violating violent events_**

We do not allow individuals or organizations involved in organized crime, including those designated by the United States government as specially designated narcotics trafficking kingpins (SDNTKs); hate; or terrorism, including entities designated by the United States government as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) or Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs), to have a presence on the platform. We also don't allow other people to represent these entities. We do not allow leaders or prominent members of these organizations to have a presence on the platform, symbols that represent them to be used on the platform, or content that glorifies them or their acts, including unclear references to them. In addition, we remove any support for these individuals and organizations.

We do not allow content that glorifies, supports, or represents events that Meta designates as terrorist attacks, hate events, multiple-victim violence or attempted multiple-victim violence, serial murders, hate crimes or violating violent events. Nor do we allow (1) content that glorifies, supports, or represents the perpetrator(s) of such attacks; (2) perpetrator-generated content relating to such attacks; or (3) third-party imagery depicting the moment of such attacks on visible victims.

We also do not allow Glorification, Support, or Representation of designated hateful ideologies, as well as unclear references to them.

Any Individual who has committed such an attack is considered to be a perpetrator or an attempted perpetrator of multiple-victim violence.
*   We consider any individual who has committed two or more murders over multiple incidents or locations a serial murderer.

**Hateful Ideologies**

*   While our designations of organizations and individuals focus on behavior, we also recognize that there are certain ideologies and beliefs that are inherently tied to violence and attempts to organize people around calls for violence or exclusion of others based on their protected characteristics.

**_Tier 2: Violent Non-State Actors and Violence Inducing Entities_**

Organizations and individuals designated by Meta as Violent Non-state Actors or Violence Inducing Entities are not allowed to have a presence on our platforms, or have a presence maintained by others on their behalf. As these communities are actively engaged in violence, against state or military actors in armed conflicts (Violent Non-State Actors) or are preparing or advocating or creating conditions for future violence (Violence Inducing Entities), material support of these entities is not allowed. We will also remove glorification of these entities.

**Violent Non-State Actors**, defined as any non-state actor that:

Adult Sexual Solicitation and Sexually Explicit Language
========================================================

Policy Rationale

As noted in the [Adult Sexual Exploitation](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/sexual_exploitation_adults) policy, people use our services to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and exploitation. We recognize the importance of and allow for this discussion.We also allow for the discussion of sex worker rights advocacy and sex work regulation. However, we draw the line at content that facilitates sexual encounters or commercial sexual services between adults or when content asks for or offers pornographic or sexual content. We do this to avoid facilitating transactions that may involve trafficking, coercion and non-consensual sexual acts.

We also restrict sexually-explicit language that may lead to sexual solicitation because some audiences within our global community may be sensitive to this type of content, and it may impede the ability for people to connect with their friends and the broader community.

We do not allow:

Content that offers, asks or provides methods of contact for prostitution, which is defined as asking for or offering oneself for sexual encounters in exchange for money or anything of value by:

*   Offering or asking for sexual encounters (for example, escort services, sexual/erotic massages, sex chats/conversations, fetish/domination services)
*   Using slang terms for prostitution combined with an ask or offer of availability, price, or any signal of a transaction for money or something of value, location, or contact information
*   Engaging in sexual solicitation combined with a price or any signal of a transaction for money or something of value
*   Depicting or mentioning sexual encounters or partners with a price or any signals of monetary or in-kind transactions.
*   Recruiting or offering other people for third-party commercial sex work is covered by the Human Exploitation policy.

Content that engages in sexual solicitation by, offering, asking or providing methods of contact for sexual encounters such as:

*   Sexual intercourse or stimulation
*   Oral sex
*   Sexual Fetishes
*   Sex chats or conversations
*   Sexual or erotic massages
*   Erotic dancing or stripping
*   Sharing of nude imagery (such as nudes, sex videos)

Content that asks for, offers or provides methods of contact to acquire pornographic material, or contains usernames or links to pornographic websites.

Sexually explicit language that uses explicit or graphic detail about:

*   Genitals
*   States of sexual arousal (e.g., wetness or erection)
*   Sexual Encounters
*   The above does not include content shared in a humorous, satirical context or as sexual cursing

We allow content that is otherwise covered by this policy when posted in condemnation, educational, awareness raising or news reporting contexts. We also do not prohibit discussing sexual practices under the policy.

Adult Sexual Exploitation
=========================

Policy Rationale

We recognize the importance of our services as a place to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and exploitation. We believe this is an important part of building common understanding and community. In an effort to create space for this conversation and promote a safe environment, we allow survivors to share their experiences, but we remove content that depicts, threatens or promotes sexual violence, sexual assault or sexual exploitation. We also remove content that displays, advocates for or coordinates sexual acts with non-consenting parties to avoid facilitating non-consensual sexual acts. Further, if we become aware of any content that threatens or advocates rape, we may disable the posting account and work with law enforcement, in addition to removing the content.

To protect survivors, we remove images that depict incidents of sexual violence and intimate images shared without the consent of the person(s) pictured. As noted in the introduction, we also work with external safety experts to discuss and improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, and we may remove content when we receive information that content is linked to harmful activity. We have written about the [technology we use to protect against non-consensual intimate images](https://about.fb.com/news/2019/03/detecting-non-consensual-intimate-images/) and the [research that has informed our work](https://about.fb.com/news/2019/03/protecting-intimate-images/). We’ve also put together a [guide to reporting and removing intimate images shared without your consent](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/not-without-my-consent.pdf).

We do not allow:

Content depicting, advocating for, or mocking non-consensual sexual touching, including:

*   Imagery depicting non-consensual sexual touching (except in real-world art depicting non-real people, with a condemning or neutral caption)

*   Descriptions of non-consensual sexual touching, unless shared by or in support of the survivor
*   Advocacy (including aspirational and conditional statements) for, threats to commit, or admission of participation in non-consensual sexual touching
*   Content mocking survivors or the concept of non-consensual sexual touching
*   Content shared by a third party that identifies survivors of sexual assault when reported by the survivor

Content, activity or interactions that attempts to exploit people by:

*   Coercing money, favors or intimate imagery from people with threats to expose their intimate imagery or intimate information (sextortion)

*   Imagery is non-commercial and produced in a private setting.
*   Person in the imagery is (near) nude, engaged in sexual activity or in a sexually suggestive pose.
*   Lack of consent to share the imagery is indicated by meeting any of the signals:
    *   Vengeful context (such as, caption, comments or page title).
    *   Independent sources such as law enforcement records, media reports (such as, leak of images confirmed by media) or representatives of a survivor of NCII
    *   Report from a person depicted in the image or who shares the same name as the person depicted in the image.

This imagery is commonly known as "creepshots" or "upskirts" and includes photos or videos that mock, sexualize or expose the person depicted in the imagery.

For the following content, we include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware the content may be upsetting to some:

Narratives and statements that contain a description of non-consensual sexual touching (written or verbal) that includes details beyond mere naming or mentioning the act if:

*   Shared by the survivor, or
*   Shared by a third party (other than the survivor) in support of the survivor or condemnation of the act or for general awareness to be determined by context/caption.

For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or context to enforce:

We may restrict visibility to people over the age of 18 and include a warning label on certain content including:

In addition to our at-scale policy of removing content that threatens or advocates rape or other non-consensual sexual touching, we may also disable the posting account.

We may also enforce on content shared by a third party that identifies survivors of sexual assault when reported by an authorized representative or Trusted Partner.

Violence and Incitement
=======================

Policy Rationale

We aim to prevent potential offline violence that may be related to content on our platforms. While we understand that people commonly express disdain or disagreement by threatening or calling for violence in non-serious and casual ways, we remove language that incites or facilitates violence and credible threats to public or personal safety. This includes violent speech targeting a person or group of people on the basis of their protected characteristic(s) or immigration status. We remove content, disable accounts and work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm or direct threats to public safety. We also try to consider the language and context in order to distinguish casual or awareness-raising statements from content that constitutes a credible threat to public or personal safety. In determining whether a threat is credible, we may also consider additional information such as a person's public visibility and the risks to their physical safety.

In some cases, we see aspirational or conditional threats of violence, including expressions of hope that violence will be committed, directed at terrorists and other violent actors (e.g., “Terrorists deserve to be killed,” “I hope they kill the terrorists”). We deem those non-credible, absent specific evidence to the contrary.

We Remove:

We remove threats of violence against various targets. Threats of violence are statements or visuals representing an intention, aspiration, or call for violence against a target, and threats can be expressed in various types of statements such as statements of intent, calls for action, advocacy, expressions of hope, aspirational statements and conditional statements.  
  
**We do not prohibit threats when shared in awareness-raising or condemning context, when less severe threats are made in the context of contact sports, or certain threats against violent actors, like terrorist groups.**  
  
**Universal protections for everyone**  
Everyone is protected from the following threats:

*   Threats of violence that could lead to death (or other forms of high-severity violence)
*   Threats of violence that could lead to serious injury (mid-severity violence). We remove such threats against public figures and groups not based on protected characteristics when credible, and we remove them against any other targets (including groups based on protected characteristics) regardless of credibility
*   Admissions to high-severity or mid-severity violence (in written or verbal form, or visually depicted by the perpetrator or an associate), except when shared in a context of redemption, self-defense, contact sports (mid-severity or less), or when committed by law enforcement, military or state security personnel
*   Threats or depictions of kidnappings or abductions, unless it is clear that the content is being shared by a victim or their family as a plea for help, or shared for informational, condemnation or awareness-raising purposes

**Additional protections for Private Adults, All Children, high-risk persons and persons or groups based on their protected characteristics:**  
In addition to the universal protections for everyone, all private adults (when self-reported), children and persons or groups of people targeted on the basis of their protected characteristic(s), are protected from threats of low-severity violence.

**Other Violence**  
In addition to all of the protections listed above, we remove the following:

*   Content that asks for, offers, or admits to offering services of high-severity violence (for example, hitmen, mercenaries, assassins, female genital mutilation) or advocates for the use of these services
*   Instructions on how to make or use weapons where there is language explicitly stating the goal to seriously injure or kill people, or imagery that shows or simulates the end result, unless with context that the content is for a non-violent purpose such as educational self-defense (for example, combat training, martial arts) and military training
*   Instructions on how to make or use explosives, unless with context that the content is for a non-violent purpose such as recreational uses (for example, fireworks and commercial video games, fishing)
*   Threats to take up weapons or to bring weapons to a location or forcibly enter a location (including but not limited to places of worship, educational facilities, polling places or locations used to count votes or administer an election), or locations where there are temporary signals of a heightened risk of violence.
*   Threats of violence related to voting, voter registration, or the administration or outcome of an election, even if there is no target.
*   Glorification of gender-based violence that is either intimate partner violence or honor-based violence

For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or context to enforce:

We Remove:

*   Threats against law enforcement officers or election officials, regardless of their public figure status or credibility of the threat.
*   Coded statements where the method of violence is not clearly articulated, but the threat is veiled or implicit, as shown by the combination of both a threat signal and contextual signal from the list below.

*   Threat: a coded statement that is one of the following:

*   Shared in a retaliatory context (e.g., expressions of desire to engage in violence against others in response to a grievance or threat that may be real, perceived or anticipated)
*   References to historical or fictional incidents of violence (e.g., content that threatens others by referring to known historical incidents of violence that have been committed throughout history or in fictional settings)
*   Acts as a threatening call to action (e.g., content inviting or encouraging others to carry out violent acts or to join in carrying out the violent acts)
*   Indicates knowledge of or shares sensitive information that could expose others to violence (e.g., content that either makes note of or implies awareness of personal information that might make a threat of violence more credible. This includes implying knowledge of a person's residential address, their place of employment or education, daily commute routes or current location)

*   Context

*   Local context or expertise confirms that the statement in question could lead to imminent violence.
*   The target of the content or an authorized representative reports the content to us.
*   The target is a child.

*   Implicit threats to bring armaments to locations, including but not limited to places of worship, educational facilities, polling places or locations used to count votes or administer an election (or encouraging others to do the same) or locations where there are temporary signals of a heightened risk of violence.
*   Claims or speculation about election-related corruption, irregularities, or bias when combined with a signal that content is threatening violence (e.g., threats to take up or bring a weapon, visual depictions of a weapon, references to arson, theft, vandalism), including:

*   Targeting individual(s)
*   Targeting a specific location (state or smaller)
*   Where the target is not explicit

*   References to election-related gatherings or events when combined with a signal that content is threatening violence (e.g., threats to take up or bring a weapon, visual depictions of a weapon, references to arson, theft, vandalism).
*   Threats of high- or mid-severity violence in the defense of self or another human when the criteria below are met.

*   Against a person (excluding persons identifiable by name or face, people targeted based on their protected characteristics, and children)
*   In the context of home entry or interpersonal violence that is proportional to the violence responded to and is an immediate threat
*   The potential impact on voice outweighs the risk of imminent violence

Hateful Conduct
===============

Policy Rationale

We believe that people use their voice and connect more freely when they don’t feel attacked on the basis of who they are. That is why we don’t allow hateful conduct on Facebook, Instagram, or Threads.

We define hateful conduct as direct attacks against people — rather than concepts or institutions — on the basis of what we call protected characteristics (PCs): race, ethnicity, national origin, disability, religious affiliation, caste, sexual orientation, sex, gender identity, and serious disease. Additionally, we consider age a protected characteristic when referenced along with another protected characteristic. We also protect refugees, migrants, immigrants, and asylum seekers from the most severe attacks (Tier 1 below), though we do allow commentary on and criticism of immigration policies. Similarly, we provide some protections for non- protected characteristics, such as occupation, when they are referenced along with a protected characteristic. Sometimes, based on local nuance, we consider certain words or phrases as frequently used proxies for protected characteristics.

We remove dehumanizing speech, allegations of serious immorality or criminality, and slurs. We also remove harmful stereotypes, which we define as dehumanizing comparisons that have historically been used to attack, intimidate, or exclude specific groups, and that are often linked with offline violence. Finally, we remove serious insults, expressions of contempt or disgust, cursing, and calls for exclusion or segregation when targeting people based on protected characteristics. We separate this speech into two tiers of severity, described below.

We recognize that people sometimes share content that includes slurs or someone else’s speech in order to condemn the speech or report on it. In other cases, speech, including slurs, that might otherwise violate our standards is used self-referentially or in an empowering way. We allow this type of speech where the speaker’s intention is clear. Where intention is unclear, we may remove content.

People sometimes use sex- or gender-exclusive language when discussing access to spaces often limited by sex or gender, such as access to bathrooms, specific schools, specific military, law enforcement, or teaching roles, and health or support groups. Other times, they call for exclusion or use insulting language in the context of discussing political or religious topics, such as when discussing transgender rights, immigration, or homosexuality. Finally, sometimes people curse at a gender in the context of a romantic break-up. Our policies are designed to allow room for these types of speech.

Do not post:

**Tier 1**

Content targeting a person or group of people (except groups described as having carried out violent or sexual crimes or representing less than half of a group) on the basis of their aforementioned protected characteristic(s) or immigration status in written or visual form with:

*   Dehumanizing speech in the form of comparisons to or generalizations about animals, pathogens, or other sub-human life forms, including:

*   Insects (including but not limited to: cockroaches, locusts)
*   Animals in general or specific types of animals that are culturally perceived as inferior (including but not limited to: Black people and apes or ape-like creatures; Jewish people and rats; Muslim people and pigs; Mexican people and worms)
*   Bacteria, viruses, or microbes
*   Subhumanity (including but not limited to: savages, devils, monsters)

*   Allegations of serious immorality and criminality:

*   Sexual predators and pedophiles (including but not limited to: Muslim people having sex with goats or pigs)
*   Violent criminals (including but not limited to: terrorists, murderers)

*   Calls and hopes for the following harms (serious or specific threats and calls for violence are addressed under our Violence and Incitement policy):

*   Contracting a disease
*   Experiencing a natural disaster
*   Self-injury or suicide
*   Death without a perpetrator or method
*   Accidents and other physical harms caused either by no perpetrator or by a deity

*   Harmful stereotypes historically linked to intimidation or violence, such as Blackface; Holocaust denial; claims that Jewish people control financial, political, or media institutions; references to Dalits as menial laborers; and comparing Black people to farm equipment.
*   Mocking the concept, events or victims of hate crimes even if no real person is depicted in an image.
*   Mocking people for having or experiencing a disease.
*   Content that describes or negatively targets people with slurs. Slurs are defined as words that inherently create an atmosphere of exclusion and intimidation against people on the basis of a protected characteristic, often because these words are tied to historical discrimination, oppression, and violence.

  

**Tier 2**

Content targeting a person or group of people on the basis of their protected characteristic(s) (in written or visual form) with:

*   Calls or support for exclusion or segregation or statements of intent to exclude or segregate, defined as:

*   General exclusion, which means calling for general exclusion or segregation, such as “No X allowed!”
*   Political exclusion, which means denying the right to political participation or arguing for incarceration or denial of political rights.
*   Economic exclusion, which means denying access to economic entitlements and limiting participation in the labor market. We do allow content arguing for gender-based limitations of military, law enforcement, and teaching jobs. We also allow the same content based on sexual orientation, when the content is based on religious beliefs.
*   Social exclusion, which means things like denying access to spaces (physical and online) and social services, except for sex or gender-based exclusion from spaces commonly limited by sex or gender, such as restrooms, sports and sports leagues, health and support groups, and specific schools.

*   Insults, including those about:

*   Character, including but not limited to allegations of cowardice, dishonesty, basic criminality, and sexual promiscuity or other sexual immorality.
*   Mental characteristics, including but not limited to allegations of stupidity, intellectual capacity, and mental illness, and unsupported comparisons between PC groups on the basis of inherent intellectual capacity. We do allow allegations of mental illness or abnormality when based on gender or sexual orientation, given political and religious discourse about transgenderism and homosexuality and common non-serious usage of words like “weird.”
*   Other areas, including but not limited to allegations of worthlessness, uselessness, ugliness, dirtiness.

*   Expressions that suggest the target causes sickness, including but not limited to “make me vomit.”
*   Targeted cursing, except certain gender-based cursing in a romantic break-up context, defined as:

*   Targeted use of “fuck” or variations of “fuck” with intent to insult, such as “Fuck the \[Protected Characteristic\]!”
*   Terms or phrases calling for engagement in sexual activity, or contact with genitalia, anus, feces or urine, including but not limited to: suck my dick, kiss my ass, eat shit.

For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or context to enforce:

Do not post:

*   Content explicitly providing or offering to provide products or services that aim to change people’s sexual orientation or gender identity.
*   Content attacking concepts, institutions, ideas, practices, or beliefs associated with protected characteristics, which are likely to contribute to imminent physical harm, intimidation or discrimination against the people associated with that protected characteristic. Meta looks at a range of signs to determine whether there is a threat of harm in the content. These include but are not limited to: content that could incite imminent violence or intimidation; whether there is a period of heightened tension such as an election or ongoing conflict; and whether there is a recent history of violence against the targeted protected group. In some cases, we may also consider whether the speaker is a public figure or occupies a position of authority.

In certain cases, we will allow content that may otherwise violate the Community Standards when it is determined that the content is satirical. Content will only be allowed if the violating elements of the content are being satirized or attributed to something or someone else in order to mock or criticize them.

Note: if you are a European Union user, and are seeing content that you believe violates hate speech laws within your country, you can submit a legal removal request to [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/319149701968527) or [Instagram](https://help.instagram.com/contact/406206379945942).

Bullying and Harassment
=======================

Policy Rationale

Bullying and harassment happen in many places and come in many different forms from making threats and releasing personally identifiable information to sending threatening messages and making unwanted malicious contact. We do not tolerate this kind of behavior because it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on Facebook, Instagram, and Threads.

We distinguish between public figures and private individuals because we want to allow discussion, which often includes critical commentary of people who are featured in the news or who have a large public audience. For public figures, we remove attacks that are severe as well as certain attacks where the public figure is directly tagged in the post or comment. We define public figures as state and national level government officials, political candidates for those offices, people with over one million fans or followers on social media and people who receive substantial news coverage.

For private individuals, our protection goes further: We remove content that's meant to degrade or shame, including, for example, claims about someone's sexual activity. We recognize that bullying and harassment can have more of an emotional impact on minors, which is why our policies provide heightened protection for anyone under the age 18, regardless of user status.

Context and intent matter, and we allow people to post and share if it is clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to bullying and harassment. In certain instances, we require self-reporting because it helps us understand that the person targeted feels bullied or harassed. In addition to reporting such behavior and content, we encourage people to use [tools available on our platforms](https://www.facebook.com/safety/tools) to help protect against it.

We also have a [Bullying Prevention Hub](https://www.facebook.com/safety/bullying), which is a resource for teens, parents, and educators seeking support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers step-by-step guidance, including information on how to start important conversations about bullying. Learn more about what we are doing to protect people from bullying and harassment [here](https://about.fb.com/news/2018/10/protecting-people-from-bullying/).

Note: This policy does not apply to individuals who are part of designated organizations under the [Dangerous Organizations and Individuals policy](https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/dangerous-individuals-organizations/) or individuals who died prior to 1900.

Suicide, Self-Injury, and Eating Disorders
==========================================

Policy Rationale

We care deeply about the safety of the people who use our apps. We regularly consult with experts in suicide, self-injury and eating disorders to help inform our policies and enforcement, and we work with organizations around the world to provide assistance to people in distress.

While we do not allow people to intentionally or unintentionally celebrate or promote suicide, self-injury or eating disorders, we do allow people to discuss these topics because we want our services to be a space where people can share their experiences, raise awareness about these issues, and seek support from one another. We may also limit the ability to view this content to adults aged 18 and older.

We remove any content that encourages suicide, self-injury or eating disorders, including fictional content such as memes or illustrations, and any self-injury content which is graphic, regardless of context. We remove content that contains instructions for extreme weight loss behaviour. We also remove content that mocks victims or survivors of suicide, self-injury or eating disorders, as well as real time depictions of suicide or self-injury. Content about recovery from suicide, self-injury or eating disorders that is allowed, but may contain imagery that could be upsetting (such as a healed scar) is placed behind a sensitivity screen and we will also limit the ability to view the content to adults aged 18 and older.

When people post or search for suicide, self-injury or eating disorders related content, we will direct them to local organizations that can provide support and if our Community Operations team is concerned about immediate harm we will contact local emergency services to get them help. For more information, visit the [Meta Safety Center.](https://www.facebook.com/safety/wellbeing/suicideprevention)

With respect to live content, experts have told us that if someone is saying they intend to attempt suicide on a livestream, we should leave the content up for as long as possible because the longer someone is talking to a camera, the more opportunity there is for a friend or family member to call emergency services.However, to minimize the risk of others being negatively impacted by viewing this content, we will stop the livestream at the point at which the threat turns into an attempt. As mentioned above, in any case, we will contact emergency services if we identify someone is at immediate risk of harming themselves.

We do not allow:

*   Content that promotes, encourages, coordinates, or provides instructions for suicide, self-injury, or eating disorders
*   Content that depicts graphic suicide, self-injury or eating disorder imagery
*   Content depicting a person who engaged in a suicide attempt or death by suicide
*   Imagery of people when shared together with terms associated with eating disorders
*   Content that focuses on depiction of ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave stomach, protruding spine, scapula, visible bones in arms or legs or hollow cheeks when shared together with terms associated with eating disorders
*   Content that contains instructions for extreme weight loss behaviour
*   Content admitting to extreme weight loss behaviour when shared together with terms associated with eating disorders
*   Content that contains instructions for restrictive dieting when shared together with terms associated with eating disorders
*   Content that mocks victims or survivors of suicide, self-injury or eating disorders who are either publicly known or implied to be experiencing or have experienced suicide, self-injury or eating disorders
*   Imagery depicting body modification (e.g., tattoo, piercing, scarification, self-flagellation, etc.) when shared in a suicide or self-injury context

For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the content may be sensitive. We also limit the ability to view the content to adults, ages 18 and older:

*   Photos or videos depicting a person who engaged in euthanasia/assisted suicide in a medical setting
*   Content that depicts older instances of self-injury such as healed cuts or other non-graphic self-injury imagery in a self-injury, suicide or recovery context
*   Content that depicts ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave stomach, protruding spine, scapula, visible bones in arms or legs or hollow cheeks in a recovery context

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v4/yh/r/3yRrWspEQ3r.png)

For the following content, we provide resources to people and limit the ability to view the content to adults aged 18 and older:

*   Written or verbal admission of suicide, self-injury or eating disorders
*   Vague, potentially suicidal statements or references (including memes or stock imagery about sad mood depression, presenting death as an escape, or content from popular culture with emphasis on dark, depressive thoughts) in a suicide or self-injury context.

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v4/yh/r/3yRrWspEQ3r.png)

For the following content, we limit the ability to view the content to adults aged 18 and older:

*   Mocking or dismissing the concept of suicide, self-injury or eating disorders
*   Narratives that contain a description of suicide with details that go beyond the mere naming or mentioning of the act or the aftermath
*   Admitting to extreme weight loss behavior

For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or context to enforce:

*   We may remove suicide notes when we have confirmation of a suicide or suicide attempt. We try to identify suicide notes using several factors, including but not limited to:
    *   Family or legal representative requests,
    *   Reports from media, law enforcement, or other third party sources (e.g. government agencies, NGOs), or the [Suicidal Content Contact Form](https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/305410456169423/) or [Instagram Contact Form](https://help.instagram.com/contact/383679321740945/).

Violent and Graphic Content
===========================

Policy Rationale

We understand that people have different sensitivities with regard to graphic and violent imagery. To protect users from such content, we remove the most graphic content and add warning labels to other types of content so that people are aware it may be sensitive before they click through. We restrict the ability for younger users to see content that may not be suitable or age-appropriate for them. By doing so, we aim to provide an appropriate user experience, while continuing to provide space for our users to express themselves.

We recognize that users may share content in order to shed light on or condemn acts such as human rights abuses or armed conflict. Our policies consider when content shared in this context and allow room for discussion and awareness raising accordingly.

For paid advertising, we provide additional protections. For example, content that has been deemed sensitive is not eligible to run in ads. We also prohibit ads from including images and videos that are shocking, gruesome, or otherwise sensational. For more information, please consult our [Advertising Standards](https://transparency.meta.com/policies/ad-standards/objectionable-content/sensational-content).
