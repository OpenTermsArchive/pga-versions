The FAQs in this section provide some information about copyrights, including how you can protect your own copyrighted works and avoid infringing the copyrights of other people when posting to Instagram, as well as how Instagram addresses reports of copyright infringement. If you believe someone is using your copyrighted work without your permission, you can fill out [this form](https://help.instagram.com/contact/372592039493026).

Please note that laws in different countries may vary. For more information on copyright law, you can visit the website of the [U.S. Copyright Office](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.instagram.com%2F%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.copyright.gov%2F) or the [World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.instagram.com%2F%3Fu=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wipo.int%2Fportal%2Fen%2Findex.html). Instagram can’t provide you with legal advice, so you may want to speak with an attorney if you have more questions about copyright.

Learn More About Copyright

In most countries, copyright is a legal right that protects original works of authorship. Typically, if you create an original work, you have a copyright from the moment you create it.

Copyright covers a wide variety of types of works, including:

* Visual or audiovisual works: videos, movies, TV shows and broadcasts, video games, paintings, photographs
* Audio works: songs, musical compositions, sound recordings, spoken word recordings
* Written works: books, plays, manuscripts, articles, musical scores

Please note, only an original work is eligible for copyright protection. To be original enough for copyright protection, a work needs to be created by the author themselves and have some minimal amount of creativity.

Generally, names, titles, slogans or short phrases aren't considered to be original enough to qualify for copyright protection. For example, the symbol “+” is likely not subject to copyright, but a painting full of shapes and colors arranged in a unique pattern is likely protected by copyright.

Copyright generally doesn’t protect facts or ideas, but it may protect the original words or images that express a fact or idea. This means that you may be able to express the same idea or fact as another author, as long as you don’t copy that author’s way of expressing that idea or fact. For example, a playwright may not be able to copyright the idea of a man waking up to repeat the same day over and over again, but the script for a play or movie expressing that idea could be subject to copyright.

In general, the person who creates an original work owns the copyright. For example, if you create a painting, you likely own the copyright for that painting. Similarly, if you take a photo, you likely own the copyright for that photo.

There may be situations where you might think you have a copyright in a creative work, but you may not. For example:

* If you appear in a photo or video, that doesn’t necessarily mean you have a copyright in that photo or video. (Learn more about [what to do](https://help.instagram.com/667810236572057?helpref=faq_content) if you think a photo or video on Instagram might violate your privacy.)
* If you take a photograph of a sculpture, that doesn’t mean you have the right to prevent someone else from also taking a photograph of the same sculpture.
* If you create a work as part of your regular job responsibilities, you might not be the owner of the copyright in that work. Instead, there are circumstances where the law will consider your employer to be the “author” of that work for copyright purposes.

If you’re not sure about the extent of your copyright in an original work, you may want to contact an attorney to advise you on your rights.

As a copyright owner, you have certain rights under the law. These include the right to stop others from copying or distributing your work, or from creating new works based on your work. Copyright infringement generally occurs when a person engages in one of these activities without the copyright owner’s permission.

For example, when someone uploads your photo or video, they make a copy of that photo or video. The same is true if someone uses a song in the soundtrack to a video, even if they paid for a copy of that song on another service.

If you own a copyright, you have the right to grant permission to use your copyrighted work, as well as the right to prevent other people from using your copyrighted work without permission.

Copyright protection doesn’t last forever. Eventually, a work loses copyright protection and becomes part of the “public domain.” Once a work is in the public domain, it’s freely available for anyone to use.

A central purpose of copyright law is to encourage people to make creative works. For this reason, the public domain ensures copyright owners obtain certain rights only for a limited amount of time. This balance between copyright law and the public domain gives the author an incentive to create, but also gives other people the ability to use the work without permission after the copyright expires.

There are many factors that determine when a work becomes part of the public domain. Some of these factors include when and where the work was first published, the type of work and the publisher. For example, the Berne Convention, an international treaty about copyright, states that the copyright for most types of works must last at least 50 years after the author’s death. Countries, however, are free to set longer copyright terms within their own laws.

The law in most countries recognizes copyrights as well as trademarks. Copyright law and trademark law serve two different purposes.

[Copyright is](https://help.instagram.com/745146219025379?helpref=faq_content) meant to foster creativity and to provide incentives to create original works of authorship for the benefit of the public. Copyright protects original works like photos, videos, movies and music. It’s also important to note that, in the U.S., the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) applies only to copyrights and doesn’t apply to trademarks.

[Trademark law is](https://help.instagram.com/693466877515116?helpref=faq_content) meant to prevent consumer harm because it prohibits someone other than the rights owner from using a trademark (for example, a brand’s logo) in a way that may confuse consumers. Trademark law protects brand names, slogans, logos or other symbols that help consumers identify the source of goods or services.

Copyright and Posting Content on Instagram

Under Instagram’s [Terms of Use](https://help.instagram.com/478745558852511) and [Community Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119/?helpref=faq_content) you can only post content to Instagram that doesn’t violate someone else's intellectual property rights. The best way to help make sure that what you post to Instagram doesn’t violate copyright law is to only post content that you’ve created yourself.

Posting content that facilitates copyright infringement through unauthorized devices or services is also not allowed on Instagram.

It's possible to infringe someone else's copyright when you post their content on Instagram, or facilitate copyright infringement, even if you:

* Bought or downloaded the content (example: a song from iTunes)
* Recorded the content onto your own recording device (examples: a song playing in the background during a party, concert, sporting event, wedding, etc.)
* Gave credit to the copyright owner
* Included a disclaimer that you didn’t intend to infringe copyright
* Didn’t intend to profit from it
* Modified the work or added your own original material to it
* Found the content available on the internet
* Saw that others posted the same content as well
* Think that the use is a [fair use](https://help.instagram.com/116455299019699?helpref=search&sr=1&query=fair%20use&search_session_id=8aa28133c81800559a4366cb5bb4c6a3)
* Are using an unauthorized streaming device or service (examples: a “jailbroken” or “loaded” app or service)

Before you post content on Instagram, you may want to ask:

* Did I create all of the content myself?
* Do I have permission to use all of the content included in my post?
* Does my use of the content fall within [an exception to copyright infringement](https://help.instagram.com/116455299019699?helpref=faq_content)?
* Is the content protected by copyright (for example, is it a short phrase, a concept or idea, or a work that has fallen into the public domain)?

It’s generally a good idea to get written permission from the author of the work before posting content on Instagram. You might be able to use someone else’s content on Instagram if you’ve gotten permission from them, such as through obtaining a license. You also may be able to use someone else's content if it's in the public domain, is covered by fair use, or there is another exception to copyright.

Learn more about [copyright and what copyright laws protect.](https://help.instagram.com/126382350847838?helpref=faq_content)

Laws across the globe recognize that strict application of copyright laws in certain cases may be unfair or may inappropriately stifle creativity or stop people from creating original works, which would harm the public. These laws allow people to use, under certain circumstances, someone else's copyrighted work. Common examples include use for the purpose of criticism, commentary, parody, satire, news reporting, teaching, education and research.

The United States and some other countries follow the “fair use” doctrine, while other countries, including those in the European Union, provide other exceptions or limitations to copyright. These exceptions or limitations permit users to use copyrighted material where appropriate. You may want to seek legal advice if you have questions about the possibility to use someone else’s copyrighted work within the limits set by the law.

Fair use

Though it's often difficult to know if a particular use of copyrighted work is a fair use, the law offers some factors you can consider:

* **The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes:**

Does the use transform or change the original work by adding new meaning, context or expression? Using a fashion photograph to discuss the amount of photo editing used in the photograph is more likely to be fair use than simply posting the photograph without comment. Parodies may be fair use if they imitate a work in a way that criticizes or comments on the original work.

Is the use commercial or purely personal? Commercial, or for-profit, uses are less likely to be considered fair use.

* **The nature of the copyrighted work:**

The use of factual works like maps or databases is more likely to be fair use than the use of highly creative works like poems or science-fiction movies.

* **The amount and substance of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole:**

The use of small portions of a copyrighted work is more likely to be fair use than copying an entire work. But even if only a small portion is used, it is less likely to be fair if that portion used is the most important piece — the “heart” of the work.

* **The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work:**

Will the use replace the original work such that people stop buying or viewing the copyrighted work? If so, this is less likely to be fair use.

To learn more about fair use in the U.S., you can visit the [U.S. Copyright Office Fair Use Index](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.instagram.com%2F%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fcopyright.gov%2Ffair-use%2F).

Exceptions to Copyright

The application of exceptions and limitations to copyright may vary from country to country. As a general matter, in countries that rely on exceptions and limitations, the use of copyrighted works should not unreasonably harm a rights holder’s interests. In the EU, each Member State must ensure that users are able to rely on the following exceptions when making content available: quotation, criticism, review, caricature, parody or pastiche. To learn more about copyright law in the EU, you can visit the [EUIPO website.](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.instagram.com%2F%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Feuipo.europa.eu%2Fohimportal%2Fen%2Fweb%2Fobservatory%2Ffaqs-on-copyright-sk)

It's possible to infringe someone else's copyright, even if you don't intend to do so. In most cases, you shouldn’t use someone else’s copyrighted work if you don’t have permission.

Keep in mind that your use of someone else’s content may infringe their copyright, even if you:

* Gave credit to the copyright owner
* Included a disclaimer that you don’t intend to infringe copyright
* Think that the use is a [fair use](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.instagram.com%2F%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F337995452911154%3Fhelpref%3Dfaq_content)
* Didn’t intend to profit from it
* Legally bought or downloaded the content (example: a copy of a DVD or a song from the Internet)
* Modified the work or added your own original material to it
* Found the content available on the internet
* Recorded the content onto your own recording device (example: from a movie, concert or sporting event)
* Saw that others have posted the same content as well

Instagram complies with the notice-and-takedown procedures set out in section 512(c) of the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which applies to content reported and removed for violating U.S. copyrights.

If your content is removed under the DMCA, you'll receive instructions about how to file a counter-notification in the messages we send you. You should only submit a counter-notification if the content was removed because of a mistake or misidentification. Please note that if your content was removed for reasons unrelated to a copyright report, you may not receive a response from us.

When we receive a valid DMCA counter-notification, we forward it to the party that reported the content. The information they receive includes your contact information, which they can use to contact you. If we provide your counter-notification to the party that reported the content, and they don't notify us that they have filed a court action seeking an order to keep the content down, we will restore or cease disabling eligible content under the DMCA. This process can take up to 14 business days. Please note, in rare instances, we may not be able to restore content due to technical limitations. If this happens, we’ll send you an update letting you know you may repost the content at your discretion.

Content that is restored based on an effective DMCA counter-notification will not be counted against you under our repeat infringer policy.

Adult Nudity and Sexual Activity
================================

#### Policy Rationale

We restrict the display of nudity or sexual activity because some people in our community may be sensitive to this type of content. Additionally, we default to removing sexual imagery to prevent the sharing of non-consensual or underage content. Restrictions on the display of sexual activity also apply to digitally created content unless it is posted for educational, humorous, or satirical purposes.

Our nudity policies have become more nuanced over time. We understand that nudity can be shared for a variety of reasons, including as a form of protest, to raise awareness about a cause, or for educational or medical reasons.

Where such intent is clear, we make allowances for the content. For example, while we restrict some images of female breasts that include the nipple, we allow other images, including those depicting acts of protest, women actively engaged in breast-feeding and photos of post-mastectomy scarring. For images depicting visible genitalia or the anus in the context of birth and after-birth moments or health-related situations we include a warning label so that people are aware that the content may be sensitive. We also allow photographs of paintings, sculptures, and other art that depicts nude figures.

#### Do not post:

* Imagery of real nude adults, if it depicts:
    * Visible genitalia except in the context of birth giving and after-birth moments or if there is medical or health context situations (for example, gender confirmation surgery, examination for cancer or disease prevention/assessment).
    * Visible anus and/or fully nude close-ups of buttocks unless photoshopped on a public figure.
    * Uncovered female nipples except in the context of breastfeeding, birth giving and after-birth moments, medical or health context (for example, post-mastectomy, breast cancer awareness or gender confirmation surgery) or an act of protest.
* Imagery of sexual activity, including:
    * Explicit sexual activity and stimulation
        * Explicit sexual intercourse or oral sex, defined as mouth or genitals entering or in contact with another person's genitals or anus, where at least one person's genitals are nude.
        * Explicit stimulation of genitalia or anus, defined as stimulating genitalia or anus or inserting objects, including sex toys, into genitalia or anus, where the contact with the genitalia or anus is directly visible.
    * Implied sexual activity and stimulation, except in cases of medical or health context, advertisements, and recognized fictional images or with indicators of fiction:
        * Implied sexual intercourse or oral sex, defined as mouth or genitals entering or in contact with another person's genitals or anus, when the genitalia and/or the activity or contact is not directly visible.
        * Implied stimulation of genitalia or anus, defined as stimulating genitalia or anus or inserting objects, including sex toys, into or above genitalia or anus, when the genitalia and/or the activity or contact is not directly visible.
    * Other activities, except in cases of medical or health context, advertisements, and recognized fictional images or with indicators of fiction, including but not limited to:
        * Erections
        * Presence of by-products of sexual activity.
        * Sex toys placed upon or inserted into mouth.
        * Stimulation of naked human nipples.
        * Squeezing female breasts, defined as a grabbing motion with curved fingers that shows both marks and clear shape change of the breasts. We allow squeezing in breastfeeding contexts.
    * Fetish content that involves:
        * Acts that are likely to lead to the death of a person or animal.
        * Dismemberment.
        * Cannibalism.
        * Feces, urine, spit, snot, menstruation or vomit.
        * Bestiality.
    * Adult sexual activity in digital art, except when posted in an educational or scientific context, or when it meets one of the criteria below and shown only to individuals 18 years and older.
* Extended audio of sexual activity

#### For the following content, we include a label so that people are aware the content may be sensitive:

Imagery of visible adult male and female genitalia, fully nude close-ups of buttocks or anus, or implied/other sexual activity, when shared in medical or health context which can include, for example:

* Birth-giving and after-birth giving moments, including both natural vaginal delivery and caesarean section
* Gender confirmation surgery
* Genitalia self-examination for cancer or disease prevention/assessment

#### We only show this content to individuals 18 and older:

* Real world art that depicts implied or explicit sexual activity.
* Imagery depicting bestiality in real-world art provided it is shared neutrally or in condemnation and the people or animals depicted are not real.
* Implied adult sexual activity in advertisements, recognized fictional images or with indicators of fiction.
* Adult sexual activity in digital art, where:
    * The sexual activity (intercourse or other sexual activities) isn’t explicit and not part of the above specified fetish content.
    * The content was posted in a satirical or humorous context.
    * Only body shapes or contours are visible.

Child Sexual Exploitation, Abuse and Nudity
===========================================

#### Policy Rationale

We do not allow content or activity that sexually exploits or endangers children. When we become aware of apparent child exploitation, we report it to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), in compliance with applicable law. We know that sometimes people share nude images of their own children with good intentions; however, we generally remove these images because of the potential for abuse by others and to help avoid the possibility of other people reusing or misappropriating the images.

We also work with external experts, including the [Facebook Safety Advisory Board](https://www.facebook.com/help/222332597793306?ref=ccs), to discuss and improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, especially with regard to children. Learn more about the [technology we’re using to fight against child exploitation](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/10/fighting-child-exploitation/).

#### Do not post:

**Child sexual exploitation**

Content or activity that threatens, depicts, praises, supports, provides instructions for, makes statements of intent, admits participation in or shares links of the sexual exploitation of children (real or non-real minors, toddlers or babies), including but not limited to:

* Sexual intercourse
    * Explicit sexual intercourse or oral sex, defined as mouth or genitals entering or in contact with another person's genitals or anus, where at least one person's genitals are nude.
    * Implied sexual intercourse or oral sex, including when contact is imminent or not directly visible.
    * Stimulation of genitals or anus, including when activity is imminent or not directly visible.
    * Presence of by-products of sexual activity.
    * Any of the above involving an animal.
* Children with sexual elements, including but not limited to:
    * Restraints.
    * Focus on genitals.
    * Presence of aroused adult.
    * Presence of sex toys.

    * Staged environment (for example, on a bed) or professionally shot (quality/focus/angles).
    * Open-mouth kissing.
* Content of children in a sexual fetish context.
* Content that supports, promotes, advocates or encourages participation in pedophilia unless it is discussed neutrally in an academic or verified health context.
* Content that identifies or mocks alleged victims of child sexual exploitation by name or image.

**Solicitation**

Content that solicits

* Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM)
* Nude imagery of children
* Sexualized imagery of children
* Real-world sexual encounters with children

**Inappropriate interactions with children**

Content that constitutes or facilitates inappropriate interactions with children, such as:

Spam
====

#### Policy Rationale

We work hard to limit the spread of spam because we do not want to allow content that is designed to deceive, or that attempts to mislead users, to increase viewership. This content creates a negative user experience, detracts from people's ability to engage authentically in online communities and can threaten the security, stability and usability of our services. We also aim to prevent people from abusing our platform, products or features to artificially increase viewership or distribute content en masse for commercial gain.

#### Do not:

* Post, share, engage with content or create accounts, Groups, Pages, Events or other assets, either manually or automatically, at very high frequencies.
* Attempt to or successfully sell, buy or exchange site privileges, engagement, or product features, such as accounts, admin roles, permission to post, Pages, Groups, likes, etc., except in the case of clearly identified branded content, as defined by our [Branded Content Policies](https://www.facebook.com/policies/brandedcontent/).

* Require or claim that users are required to engage with content (e.g. liking, sharing) before they are able to view or interact with promised content.
* Encourage likes, shares, follows, clicks or the use of apps or websites under false pretenses, such as:
    * Offering false or non-existent services or functionality(e.g. “Get a ‘Dislike’ button!”)
    * Failing to direct to promised content (e.g. “Click here for a discount code at Nordstrom”; _false play buttons_)
    * The deceptive or misleading use of URLs, defined as:
        * **Cloaking**: Presenting different content to Facebook users and Facebook crawlers or tools.
        * **Misleading content**: Content contains a link that promises one type of content but delivers something substantially different.
        * **Deceptive redirect behavior**: Websites that require an action (e.g. captcha, watch ad, click here) in order to view the expected landing page content and the domain name of the URL changes after the required action is complete.
        * **Like/share-gating**: Landing pages that require users to like, share, or otherwise engage with content before gaining access to content.
        * **Deceptive landing page functionality**: Websites that have a misleading user interface, which results in accidental traffic being generated (e.g. pop-ups/unders, clickjacking, etc.).
        * **Typosquatting**: An external website pretends to be a reputable brand or service by using a name, domain or content that features typos, misspellings or other means to impersonate well-known brands using a landing page similar to another, trusted site to mislead visitors (e.g. www.faceb00k.com, www.face\_book.com).
        * And other behaviors that are substantially similar to the above.

Account Integrity and Authentic Identity
========================================

#### Policy Rationale

Authenticity is the cornerstone of our community. We believe that authenticity helps create a community where people are accountable to each other, and to Facebook, in meaningful ways. We want to allow for the range of diverse ways that identity is expressed across our global community, while also preventing impersonation and identity misrepresentation. That is why we require people to connect on Facebook using the name they go by in everyday life. Our authenticity policies are intended to create a safe environment where people can trust and hold one another accountable.

In order to maintain a safe environment and empower free expression, we remove accounts that are harmful to the community, including those that compromise the security of other accounts and our services. We have built a combination of automated and manual systems to block and remove accounts that are used to persistently or egregiously abuse our Community Standards.

Because account level removal is a severe action, whenever possible, we aim to give our community a chance to learn our rules and follow our Community Standards. Penalties, including account disables, are designed to be proportionate to the severity of the violation and the risk of harm posed to the community. Continued violations, despite repeated warnings and restrictions, or violations that pose severe safety risks will lead to an account being disabled.

#### We do not allow the use of our services and will restrict or disable accounts or other entities (such as pages, groups, and events) if you:

* [Severely violate](https://transparency.fb.com/enforcement/taking-action/disabling-accounts/) our Community Standards.
* [Persistently violate](https://transparency.fb.com/enforcement/taking-action/disabling-accounts/) our Community Standards.
* Coordinate as part of a network of accounts or other entities in order to violate or evade our Community Standards.
* Represent [Dangerous Individuals or Organizations](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/dangerous_individuals_organizations).
* Create or use an account that demonstrates an intent to violate our Community Standards.
* Create or use an account by scripted or other inauthentic means.
* Create an account, Page, Group or Event to evade our enforcement actions, including creating an account to bypass a restriction or after we have disabled your previous account, Page, Group or Event.
* Impersonate others by:
    * Using their photos with the explicit aim to deceive others.
    * Creating an account assuming to be or speak for another person or entity.
    * Creating a Page assuming to be or speak for another person or entity for whom the user is not authorized to do so.
* Are under 13 years old.
* Are a convicted sex offender.
* Are prohibited from receiving our products, services or software under applicable laws.

#### In certain cases, such as those outlined below, we will seek further information about an account before taking actions ranging from temporarily restricting accounts to permanently disabling them.

* Accounts misrepresenting their identity (Facebook and Messenger only) by:
    * Using a name that is not the [authentic name](https://www.facebook.com/help/112146705538576?ref=ccs) you go by in everyday life
        * Using an inherently violating name, containing slurs or any other violations of the [Community Standards](https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/)
    * Providing a false date of birth.
    * Creating a single account that represents or is used by more than one person.
    * Maintaining multiple accounts as a single user.
* Compromised accounts.
* Empty accounts with prolonged dormancy.

Inauthentic Behavior
====================

#### Policy Rationale

In line with our commitment to authenticity, we do not allow people to misrepresent themselves on Facebook, use fake accounts, artificially boost the popularity of content or engage in behaviors designed to enable other violations under our Community Standards. This policy is intended to protect the security of user accounts and our services, and create a space where people can trust the people and communities they interact with.

#### Do not:

* Use multiple Facebook accounts or share accounts between multiple people
* Misuse Facebook or Instagram reporting systems to harass others
* Conceal a Page’s purpose by misleading users about the ownership or control of that Page
* Engage in or claim to engage in inauthentic behavior, which is defined as the use of Facebook or Instagram assets (accounts, Pages, Groups, or Events), to mislead people or Facebook:
    * About the identity, purpose, or origin of the entity that they represent.
    * About the popularity of Facebook or Instagram content or assets.
    * About the purpose of an audience or community.
    * About the source or origin of content.
    * To evade enforcement under our Community Standards.

For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or context to enforce:

* We do not allow entities to engage in, or claim to engage in Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior, defined as the use of multiple Facebook or Instagram assets, working in concert to engage in Inauthentic Behavior (as defined above), where the use of fake accounts is central to the operation
* We do not allow entities to engage in, or claim to engage in foreign or government interference, which is Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior conducted on behalf of a foreign or government actor.
* We do not allow governments that have instituted sustained blocks of social media to use their official departments, agencies, and embassies to deny the use of force or violent events in the context of an attack against the territorial integrity of another state in violation of Article 2(4) of the UN charter.

Dangerous Individuals and Organizations
=======================================

#### Policy Rationale

In an effort to prevent and disrupt real-world harm, we do not allow organizations or individuals that proclaim a violent mission or are engaged in violence to have a presence on Facebook. We assess these entities based on their behavior both online and offline, most significantly, their ties to violence. Under this policy, we designate individuals, organizations, and networks of people. These designations are divided into three tiers that indicate the level of content enforcement, with Tier 1 resulting in the most extensive enforcement because we believe these entities have the most direct ties to offline harm.

**Tier 1** focuses on entities that engage in serious offline harms - including organizing or advocating for violence against civilians, repeatedly dehumanizing or advocating for harm against people based on protected characteristics, or engaging in systematic criminal operations. Tier 1 entities include terrorist, hate, and criminal organizations. We remove praise, substantive support, and representation of Tier 1 entities as well as their leaders, founders, or prominent members. Tier 1 includes hate organizations; criminal organizations, including those designated by the United States government as Specially Designated Narcotics Trafficking Kingpins (SDNTKs); and terrorist organizations, including entities and individuals designated by the United States government as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) or Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs). We remove praise, substantive support, and representation of Tier 1 entities as well as their leaders, founders, or prominent members.

In addition, we do not allow content that praises, substantively supports, or represents events that Facebook designates as violating violent events - including terrorist attacks, hate events, multiple-victim violence or attempted multiple-victim violence, multiple murders, or hate crimes. Nor do we allow praise, substantive support, or representation of the perpetrator(s) of such attacks. We also remove content that praises, substantively supports or represents ideologies that promote hate, such as nazism and white supremacy.

**Tier 2** focuses on entities that engage in violence against state or military actors but do not generally target civilians -- what we call “Violent Non-State Actors.” We remove all substantive support and representation of these entities, their leaders, and their prominent members. We remove any praise of these groups’ violent activities.

**Tier 3** focuses on entities that may repeatedly engage in violations of our Hate Speech or Dangerous Organizations policies on-or-off the platform or demonstrate strong intent to engage in offline violence in the near future, but have not necessarily engaged in violence to date or advocated for violence against others based on their protected characteristics. This includes Militarized Social Movements, Violence-Inducing Conspiracy Networks, and individuals and groups banned for promoting hatred. Tier 3 entities may not have a presence or coordinate on our platforms.

We recognize that users may share content that includes references to designated dangerous organizations and individuals to report on, condemn, or neutrally discuss them or their activities. Our policies are designed to allow room for these types of discussions while simultaneously limiting risks of potential offline harm. We thus require people to clearly indicate their intent when creating or sharing such content. If a user's intention is ambiguous or unclear, we default to removing content.

In line with international human rights law, our policies allow discussions about the human rights of designated individuals or members of designated dangerous entities, unless the content includes other praise, substantive support, or representation of designated entities or other policy violations, such as incitement to violence.

Please see our [Corporate Human Rights Policy](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Facebooks-Corporate-Human-Rights-Policy.pdf) for more information about our commitment to internationally recognized human rights.

We remove Praise of Tier 1 entities and designated events. We will also remove praise of violence carried out by Tier 2 entities.

**Substantive Support**, defined as any of the below:

    * E.g., “If you want to send care packages to the Sinaloa Cartel, use this address:”
* Putting out a call to action on behalf of a designated entity or event;
    * E.g., “Contact the Atomwaffen Division - (XXX) XXX-XXXX”
* Recruiting on behalf of a designated entity or event;

We remove Substantive Support of Tier 1 and Tier 2 entities and designated events.

**Representation**, defined as any of the below:

We also don't allow other people to represent these entities. We do not allow leaders or prominent members of these organizations to have a presence on the platform, symbols that represent them to be used on the platform, or content that praises them or their acts. In addition, we remove any coordination of substantive support for these individuals and organizations.

Any Individual who has committed such an attack is considered to be a perpetrator or an attempted perpetrator of multiple-victim violence.
* We consider any individual who has committed two or more murders over multiple incidents or locations a multiple murderer.

**Hateful Ideologies**

* While our designations of organizations and individuals focus on behavior, we also recognize that there are certain ideologies and beliefs that are inherently tied to violence and attempts to organize people around calls for violence or exclusion of others based on their protected characteristics. In these cases, we designate the ideology itself and remove content that supports this ideology from our platform. These ideologies include:
    * Nazism
    * White Supremacy
    * White Nationalism
    * White Separatism
* We remove explicit Praise, Substantive Support, and Representation of these ideologies, and remove individuals and organizations that ascribe to one or more of these hateful ideologies.

**_Tier 2: Violent Non-State Actors_**

Organizations and individuals designated by Meta as Violent Non-state Actors are not allowed to have a presence on Facebook, or have a presence maintained by others on their behalf.

**Violent Non-State Actors**, defined as any non-state actor that:

* engages in purposive and planned acts of violence primarily against a government military or other armed communities; and

Sexual Solicitation
===================

#### Policy Rationale

As noted in Section 8 of our Community Standards ([Adult Sexual Exploitation](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/sexual_exploitation_adults)), people use Facebook to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and exploitation. We recognize the importance of and allow for this discussion.We also allow for the discussion of sex worker rights advocacy and sex work regulation. We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or coordinates sexual encounters or commercial sexual services between adults. We do this to avoid facilitating transactions that may involve trafficking, coercion and non-consensual sexual acts.

We also restrict sexually-explicit language that may lead to sexual solicitation because some audiences within our global community may be sensitive to this type of content, and it may impede the ability for people to connect with their friends and the broader community.

#### Do not post:

Content that offers or asks for adult commercial services, such as requesting, offering or asking for rates for escort service and paid sexual fetish or domination services. (Content that recruits or offers other people for third-party commercial sex work is separately considered under [the Human Exploitation policy).](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/human_exploitation)

Attempted coordination of or recruitment for, adult sexual activities, except when promoting an event or venue, including but not limited to:

* Filmed sexual activities.
* Pornographic activities, strip club shows, live sex performances or erotic dances.
* Sexual, erotic or tantric massages.

Explicit sexual solicitation by, including but not limited to the following, offering or asking for:

* Offering or asking for sex or sexual partners (including partners who share fetish or sexual interests).
* Sex chat or conversations.
* Nude photos/videos/imagery/sexual fetish items.
* Sexual slang terms.

We allow expressing desire for sexual activity, promoting sex education, discussing sexual practices or experiences, or offering classes or programs that teach techniques or discuss sex.

Content that is implicitly or indirectly offering or asking for sexual solicitation and meets both of the following criteria. If both criteria are not met, it is not deemed to be violating. For example, if content is a hand-drawn image depicting sexual activity but does not ask or offer sexual solicitation, it is not violating:

* **Criteria 1: Offer or ask**
    * Content that implicitly or indirectly (typically through providing a method of contact) offers or asks for sexual solicitation.
* **Criteria 2: Suggestive Elements**
    * Content that makes the aforementioned offer or ask using one of the following sexually suggestive elements:
        * Contextually specific and commonly sexual emojis or emoji strings, or
        * Regional sexualized slang, or
        * Mentions or depictions of sexual activity (including hand drawn, digital, or real-world art) such as sexual roles, sex positions, fetish scenarios, state of arousal, act of sexual intercourse or activity (e.g. sexual penetration or self-pleasuring), or
        * Poses.
        * Audio of sexual activity or other content that violates the [Adult Nudity and Sexual Activity](https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/adult-nudity-sexual-activity/)

An offer or ask for pornographic material (including, but not limited to, sharing of links to external pornographic websites)

Sexually-explicit language that goes into graphic detail beyond mere reference to:

* A state of sexual arousal (e.g wetness or erection) or
* An act of sexual intercourse (e.g sexual penetration, self-pleasuring or exercising fetish scenarios).
* Except for content shared in a humorous, satirical, or educational context, as a sexual metaphor or as sexual cursing.

#### For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or context to enforce:

* In certain cases, we will allow content that may otherwise violate the Community Standards when it is determined that the content is satirical. Content will only be allowed if the violating elements of the content are being satirized or attributed to something or someone else in order to mock or criticize them.

Restricted Goods and Services
=============================

#### Policy Rationale

Brick-and-mortar and online retailers may promote firearms, alcohol, and tobacco items available for sale off of our services; however, we restrict visibility of this content for minors. We allow discussions about the sale of these goods in stores or by online retailers, as well as advocating for changes to regulations of goods and services covered in this policy.

#### Do not post:

Child Sexual Exploitation, Abuse and Nudity
===========================================

#### Policy Rationale

We do not allow content or activity that sexually exploits or endangers children. When we become aware of apparent child exploitation, we report it to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), in compliance with applicable law. We know that sometimes people share nude images of their own children with good intentions; however, we generally remove these images because of the potential for abuse by others and to help avoid the possibility of other people reusing or misappropriating the images.

We also work with external experts, including the [Facebook Safety Advisory Board](https://www.facebook.com/help/222332597793306?ref=ccs), to discuss and improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, especially with regard to children. Learn more about the [technology we’re using to fight against child exploitation](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/10/fighting-child-exploitation/).

Adult Sexual Exploitation
=========================

#### Policy Rationale

We recognize the importance of Facebook as a place to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and exploitation. In an effort to create space for this conversation and promote a safe environment, we allow victims to share their experiences, but remove content that depicts, threatens or promotes sexual violence, sexual assault, or sexual exploitation. We also remove content that displays, advocates for or coordinates sexual acts with non-consenting parties to avoid facilitating non-consensual sexual acts.

To protect victims and survivors, we remove images that depict incidents of sexual violence and intimate images shared without the consent of the person(s) pictured. As noted in the introduction, we also work with external safety experts to discuss and improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, and we may remove content when they provide information that content is linked to harmful activity. We have written about the [technology we use to protect against intimate images](https://about.fb.com/news/2019/03/detecting-non-consensual-intimate-images/) and the [research that has informed our work](https://about.fb.com/news/2019/03/protecting-intimate-images/). We’ve also put together a [guide to reporting and removing intimate images shared without your consent](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/not-without-my-consent.pdf).

#### Do not post:

In instances where content consists of any form of non-consensual sexual touching, necrophilia, or forced stripping, including:

* Depictions (including real photos/videos except in a real-world art context), or
* Sharing, offering, asking for or threatening to share imagery, or
* Descriptions, unless shared by or in support of the victim/survivor, or
* Advocacy (including aspirational and conditional statements), or
* Statements of intent, or
* Calls for action, or
* Admitting participation, or
* Mocking victims of any of the above.
* We will also take down content shared by a third party that identifies victims or survivors of sexual assault when reported by the victim or survivor.

Content that attempts to exploit people by any of the following:

* Sextortion: Coercing money, favors or intimate imagery from people with threats to expose their intimate imagery or intimate information
* Sharing, threatening, stating an intent to share, offering or asking for non-consensual intimate imagery that fulfills all of the 3 following conditions:
    * Imagery is non-commercial or produced in a private setting.
    * Person in the imagery is (near) nude, engaged in sexual activity or in a sexual pose.
    * Lack of consent to share the imagery is indicated by meeting any of the signals:
        * Vengeful context (such as, caption, comments or page title).
        * Independent sources (such as, law enforcement record) including entertainment media (such as, leak of images confirmed by media).
        * A visible match between the person depicted in the image and the person who has reported the content to us.
        * The person who reported the content to us shares the same name as the person depicted in the image.
* Secretly taken non-commercial imagery of a real person's commonly sexualized body parts (breasts, groin, buttocks, or thighs) or of a real person engaged in sexual activity. This imagery is commonly known as "creepshots" or "upskirts" and includes photos or videos that mock, sexualize or expose the person depicted in the imagery.

#### For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the content may be disturbing:

Narratives and statements that contain a description of non-consensual sexual touching (written or verbal) that includes details beyond mere naming or mentioning the act if:

* Shared by the victim, or
* Shared by a third party (other than the victim) in support of the victim or condemnation of the act or for general awareness to be determined by context/caption.

Content mocking the concept of non-consensual sexual touching

#### For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or context to enforce:

We may restrict visibility to people over the age of 18 and include a warning label on certain fictional videos (e.g., digital and hand-drawn imagery, film and TV show scenes, comic books, music videos) that depict non-consensual sexual touching.

In addition to our at-scale policy of removing content that threatens or advocates rape or other non-consensual sexual touching, we may also disable the posting account.

We may also enforce on content shared by a third party that identifies survivors of sexual assault when reported by an authorized representative or Trusted Partner.

Violence and Incitement
=======================

#### Policy Rationale

We aim to prevent potential offline harm that may be related to content on Facebook. While we understand that people commonly express disdain or disagreement by threatening or calling for violence in non-serious ways, we remove language that incites or facilitates serious violence. We remove content, disable accounts and work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm or direct threats to public safety. We also try to consider the language and context in order to distinguish casual statements from content that constitutes a credible threat to public or personal safety. In determining whether a threat is credible, we may also consider additional information like a person's public visibility and the risks to their physical safety.

In some cases, we see aspirational or conditional threats directed at terrorists and other violent actors (e.g. "Terrorists deserve to be killed"), and we deem those non-credible, absent specific evidence to the contrary.

#### Do not post:

Threats that could lead to death (and other forms of high-severity violence) and admission of past violence targeting people or places where threat is defined as any of the following:

* Statements of intent to commit high-severity violence. This includes content where a symbol represents the target and/or includes a visual of an armament or method to represent violence.
* Calls for high-severity violence including content where no target is specified but a symbol represents the target and/or includes a visual of an armament or method that represents violence.

Threats of high-severity violence using digitally-produced or altered imagery to target living people with armaments, methods of violence or dismemberment

Threats that lead to serious injury (mid-severity violence) and admission of past violence toward private individuals, unnamed specified persons, minor public figures, high-risk persons or high-risk groups where threat is defined as any of the following:

* Calls for mid-severity violence including content where no target is specified but a symbol represents the target, or

Any content containing statements of intent, calls for action, conditional or aspirational statements, or advocating for violence due to voting, voter registration or the administration or outcome of an election

Statements of intent or advocacy, calls to action, or aspirational or conditional statements to bring weapons to locations, including but not limited to places of worship, educational facilities, polling places or locations used to count votes or administer an election (or encouraging others to do the same).

#### For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or context to enforce:

Do not post:

* Violent threats against law enforcement officers.
* Violent threats against people accused of a crime. We remove this content when we have reason to believe that the content is intended to cause physical harm.

* Coded statements where the method of violence or harm is not clearly articulated, but the threat is veiled or implicit. Meta looks at the below signals to determine whether there is a threat of harm in the content.

* Indicates knowledge of or shares sensitive information that could expose others to harm (e.g. content that either makes note of or implies awareness of personal information that might make a threat of physical violence more credible. This includes implying knowledge of a person's residential address, their place of employment or education, daily commute routes or current location)
* Local context or subject matter expertise confirms that the statement in question could be threatening and/or could lead to imminent violence or physical harm.
* The subject of the threat reports the content to us.

* Threats against election workers, including claims of election-related wrongdoing against private individuals when combined with a signal of violence or additional context that confirms that the claim could lead to imminent violence or physical harm.
* Implicit statements of intent or advocacy, calls to action, or aspirational or conditional statements to bring armaments to locations, including but not limited to places of worship, educational facilities, polling places, or locations used to count votes or administer an election (or encouraging others to do the same). We may also restrict calls to bring armaments to certain locations where there are temporarily signals of a heightened risk of violence or offline harm. This may be the case, for example, when there is a known protest and counter-protest planned or violence broke out at a protest in the same city within the last 7 days

Hate Speech
===========

#### Policy Rationale

We believe that people use their voice and connect more freely when they don’t feel attacked on the basis of who they are. That is why we don’t allow hate speech on Facebook. It creates an environment of intimidation and exclusion, and in some cases may promote offline violence.

We define hate speech as a direct attack against people — rather than concepts or institutions— on the basis of what we call protected characteristics: race, ethnicity, national origin, disability, religious affiliation, caste, sexual orientation, sex, gender identity and serious disease. We define attacks as violent or dehumanizing speech, harmful stereotypes, statements of inferiority, expressions of contempt, disgust or dismissal, cursing and calls for exclusion or segregation. We also prohibit the use of harmful stereotypes, which we define as dehumanizing comparisons that have historically been used to attack, intimidate, or exclude specific groups, and that are often linked with offline violence. We consider age a protected characteristic when referenced along with another protected characteristic. We also protect refugees, migrants, immigrants and asylum seekers from the most severe attacks, though we do allow commentary and criticism of immigration policies. Similarly, we provide some protections for characteristics like occupation, when they’re referenced along with a protected characteristic. Sometimes, based on local nuance, we consider certain words or phrases as frequently used proxies for PC groups.

We also prohibit the usage of slurs that are used to attack people on the basis of their protected characteristics. However, we recognize that people sometimes share content that includes slurs or someone else's hate speech to condemn it or raise awareness. In other cases, speech, including slurs, that might otherwise violate our standards can be used self-referentially or in an empowering way. Our policies are designed to allow room for these types of speech, but we require people to clearly indicate their intent. If the intention is unclear, we may remove content.

#### Do not post:

Facebook looks at a range of signs to determine whether there is a threat of harm in the content. These include but are not limited to: content that could incite imminent violence or intimidation; whether there is a period of heightened tension such as an election or ongoing conflict; and whether there is a recent history of violence against the targeted protected group. In some cases, we may also consider whether the speaker is a public figure or occupies a position of authority.

Bullying and Harassment
=======================

#### Policy Rationale

Bullying and harassment happen in many places and come in many different forms from making threats and releasing personally identifiable information to sending threatening messages and making unwanted malicious contact. We do not tolerate this kind of behavior because it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on Facebook.

We distinguish between public figures and private individuals because we want to allow discussion, which often includes critical commentary of people who are featured in the news or who have a large public audience. For public figures, we remove attacks that are severe as well as certain attacks where the public figure is directly tagged in the post or comment.

For private individuals, our protection goes further: We remove content that's meant to degrade or shame, including, for example, claims about someone's sexual personal activity. We recognize that bullying and harassment can have more of an emotional impact on minors, which is why our policies provide heightened protection for users between the ages of 13 and 18.

Context and intent matter, and we allow people to post and share if it is clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to bullying and harassment. In certain instances, we require self-reporting because it helps us understand that the person targeted feels bullied or harassed. In addition to reporting such behavior and content, we encourage people to use [tools available on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/safety/tools) to help protect against it.

We also have a [Bullying Prevention Hub](https://www.facebook.com/safety/bullying), which is a resource for teens, parents, and educators seeking support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers step-by-step guidance, including information on how to start important conversations about bullying. Learn more about what we are doing to protect people from bullying and harassment [here](https://about.fb.com/news/2018/10/protecting-people-from-bullying/).

Suicide and Self Injury
=======================

#### Policy Rationale

We care deeply about the safety of the people who use our apps. We regularly consult with experts in suicide and self-injury to help inform our policies and enforcement, and work with organizations around the world to provide assistance to people in distress.

While we do not allow people to intentionally or unintentionally celebrate or promote suicide or self-injury, we do allow people to discuss these topics because we want Facebook to be a space where people can share their experiences, raise awareness about these issues, and seek support from one another.

We define self-injury as the intentional and direct injuring of the body, including self-mutilation and eating disorders. We remove any content that encourages suicide or self-injury, including fictional content such as memes or illustrations and any self-injury content which is graphic, regardless of context. We also remove content that identifies and negatively targets victims or survivors of suicide or self-injury seriously, humorously or rhetorically, as well as real time depictions of suicide or self-injury. Content about recovery of suicide or self-harm that is allowed, but may contain imagery that could be upsetting, such as a healed scar, is placed behind a sensitivity screen.

When people post or search for suicide or self-injury- related content, we will direct them to local organizations that can provide support and if our Community Operations team is concerned about immediate harm we will contact local emergency services to get them help. For more information, visit the [Facebook Safety Center.](https://www.facebook.com/safety/wellbeing/suicideprevention)

With respect to live content, experts have told us that if someone is saying they intend to attempt suicide on a livestream, we should leave the content up for as long as possible, because the longer someone is talking to a camera, the more opportunity there is for a friend or family member to call emergency services.

However, to minimize the risk of others being negatively impacted by viewing this content, we will stop the livestream at the point at which the threat turns into an attempt. As mentioned above, in any case, we will contact emergency services if we identify someone is at immediate risk of harming themselves.

#### Do not post:

Content that promotes, encourages, coordinates, or provides instructions for

* Suicide.
* Self-injury.
* Eating disorders.

Content that depicts graphic self-injury imagery

It is against our policies to post content depicting a person who engaged in a suicide attempt or death by suicide

Content that focuses on depiction of ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave stomach, or protruding spine or scapula when shared together with terms associated with eating disorders

Content that contains instructions for drastic and unhealthy weight loss when shared together with terms associated with eating disorders.

Content that mocks victims or survivors of suicide, self-injury or eating disorders who are either publicly known or implied to have experienced suicide or self-injury

#### For the following content, we restrict content to adults over the age of 18, and include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware the content may be upsetting:

* Photos or videos depicting a person who engaged in euthanasia/assisted suicide in a medical setting.

#### For the following content, we include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware the content may be upsetting to some:

* Content that depicts older instances of self-harm such as healed cuts or other non-graphic self-injury imagery in a self-injury, suicide or recovery context.
* Content that depicts ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave stomach, or protruding spine or scapula in a recovery context.

#### We provide resources to people who post written or verbal admissions of engagement in self injury, including:

* Suicide.
* Euthanasia/assisted suicide.
* Self-harm.
* Eating disorders.
* Vague, potentially suicidal statements or references (including memes or stock imagery about sad mood or depression) in a suicide or self-injury context.

#### For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or context to enforce:

* We may remove suicide notes when we have confirmation of a suicide or suicide attempt. We try to identify suicide notes using several factors, including but not limited to, family or legal representative requests, media reports, law enforcement reports or other third party sources (e.g. government agencies, NGOs).
    * A suicide note may also be removed when reported through the [Suicidal Content Contact Form](https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/305410456169423/) or [Instagram Contact Form](https://help.instagram.com/contact/383679321740945/) when we have confirmation of a suicide or suicide attempt

===========================

#### Policy Rationale

To protect users from disturbing imagery, we remove content that is particularly violent or graphic, such as videos depicting dismemberment, visible innards or charred bodies. We also remove content that contains sadistic remarks towards imagery depicting the suffering of humans and animals.

In the context of discussions about important issues such as human rights abuses, armed conflicts or acts of terrorism, we allow graphic content (with some limitations) to help people to condemn and raise awareness about these situations.

We know that people have different sensitivities with regard to graphic and violent imagery. For that reason, we add a warning label to some graphic or violent imagery so that people are aware it may be sensitive before they click through. We also restrict the ability for users under 18 to view such content.
