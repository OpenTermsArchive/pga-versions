### About cookies

Cookies and other technologies are used to store and receive information (including identifiers) on or from computers, mobile phones and other devices. In this policy, we refer to cookies and these other technologies as “cookies”.  

  

### What does this policy cover

This policy explains how we use cookies and the choices you have, when you use our web-based Services, our website or our optional features on our Services such as Status and Channels. The Privacy Policy and [any supplemental policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/) which is relevant to your use of our Services applies to our processing of the information we collect through cookies.  

  

### How we use cookies

We use cookies to understand, secure, operate, personalise and provide our Services. For example:

*   **Site features and services**. We use cookies to provide WhatsApp for web and desktop and other Services that are web-based. For example, we use the wa\_lang\_pref cookie to remember your choices, such as your language preferences on the website.
*   **Analytics.** We use cookies to understand how our website is being used in order to rank the FAQs on our website based on popularity, understand mobile versus desktop users of our web-based Services, or understand popularity and effectiveness of certain of our web pages. For example, we use the wa\_ul cookie to count visitors to FAQs so we can rank the FAQs based on popularity.
*   **Security.** We use cookies to protect the WhatsApp website. For example, we use the wa\_csrf cookie to prevent attacks from bad actors.
*   **Advertising.** We use cookies when you use Status and Channels, which are optional, to help show you ads and measure how they perform. For example, we use a unique user identifier that allows us to display the ad correctly to users.
