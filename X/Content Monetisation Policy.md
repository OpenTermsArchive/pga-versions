X’s Creator Monetization Standards
==================================

**All content on X is subject to the [X’s User Agreement](https://x.com/en/tos.html), including the [X Rules](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-rules.html). As you seek to get paid from X for your content on the platform, remember that monetized content, like other content on X, must be in compliance with our rules on [Safety, Authenticity, and Privacy](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-rules.html).** 

In addition, if you earn money or currency from X via any of our creator monetization products, you are subject to X’s **Creator Monetization Standards**, which includes eligibility, content and conduct standards, as outlined on this page.

Creator Revenue Sharing Terms
=============================

Creator Revenue Sharing Terms
=============================

goglobalwithtwitterbanner

**Effective: August 1, 2025**

These Creator Revenue Share Terms (“**Terms**”) are between you and X Corp., on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (collectively, “**X**” or “**we**”) and govern your participation in X’s Creator Revenue Share Program (the “**Program**”). In these Terms, “**Affiliate**” means any entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with X, and “**you**,” “**your**,” or “**Creator**” means you, an individual, company or any other entity with a X account participating in the Program. If you are entering into these Terms on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant you are authorized on such entity’s behalf.

To participate in the Program, you must be at least 18 years old, and meet the other eligibility requirements set forth in [Section 2](https://legal.x.com/creator-revenue-sharing-terms.html#SF-Chapter2).

In addition to these Terms, your participation in this Program is subject to the [X Terms of Service](https://x.com/tos), the [X Privacy Policy](https://x.com/privacy), the [X Rules and Policies](https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies#x-rules), the [Creator Monetization Standards](https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies/content-monetization-standards), and all policies incorporated therein (collectively, the “**X User Agreement**”).

Please read these Revenue Share Terms carefully to make sure you understand the applicable terms, conditions and exceptions. IF YOU LIVE IN THE UNITED STATES, THESE TERMS CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION THAT APPLY TO YOU ABOUT RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT, INCLUDING A WAIVER OF YOUR RIGHT TO BRING CLAIMS AS CLASS ACTIONS AND THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT, AND A LIMITATION ON YOUR RIGHT TO BRING CLAIMS AGAINST X MORE THAN 1 YEAR AFTER THE RELEVANT EVENTS OCCURRED, WHICH IMPACTS YOUR RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS IF ANY DISPUTE WITH X ARISES. SEE [SECTION 13](https://legal.x.com/creator-revenue-sharing-terms.html#SF-Chapter13) FOR DETAILS ON THESE PROVISIONS.

By participating in the Program (if you are approved by X) or otherwise indicating your acceptance (for example, by agreeing to these Terms when applying to the Program, clicking “Join & set up payouts,” etc.), you represent and warrant that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by these Terms. By accepting these Terms, you further consent to X’s use of the data that you provide, we collect about you, or we infer about you to consider your acceptance to the Program. If you do not agree, do not participate in the Program.

X Creator Revenue Sharing lets you share in the revenue from engagement with your content on X. Payments to you are made through our Payment Partner if the revenue share reaches a certain threshold during our periodic payout schedule. X may amend or cancel the Program at any time in its sole discretion, including for business, financial, or legal reasons. 

The eligibility requirements for the Program can be found in our [Help Center](https://help.x.com/using-x/creator-revenue-sharing), and may change from time to time, including for any business, financial, or legal reasons. To join the Program, for example, you must:

Additionally, prior to payout you must complete identity verification. Please also see the Payments section below for payment details. If your account does not meet an eligibility requirement or violates the X User Agreement, you will be notified via email. You will have an opportunity to appeal by writing to X by responding to the email we will send to you. If you do not appeal or we reject your appeal, you will be ineligible to join the Program. X reserves the right to reject applications at its sole discretion, including for business, financial, or legal reasons.  

If your participating account violates our rules and policies, including the X User Agreement, we will notify you and pause your participation in the program. You will have an opportunity to appeal by writing to X by responding to the email we will send to you with meaningful evidence that your account should be reinstated. If the evidence is insufficient, or you fail to respond, we will cancel your participation and block future eligibility. 

If you wish to cancel your participation from the Program, you can do so by following the steps to cancel via the [Help Center](https://help.x.com/using-x/creator-revenue-sharing) guide. Upon cancellation, you will be paid your remaining funds above the minimum amount set forth in the [Help Center](https://help.x.com/using-x/creator-revenue-sharing). You waive your right to all other funds. 

Please note that employees of X, and [our Services and Corporate Affiliates](https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies/x-services-and-corporate-affiliates) are ineligible for participation in the Program, unless otherwise pre-approved by authorized personnel of X.

Your share of the revenue from this program is not transferable between X accounts.

Your participation in the Program must not violate any applicable laws, rules or regulations. You are solely responsible for any violation by you or your account of any applicable laws, rules or regulations. We may impose additional limits based on anti-money laundering, sanctions or anti-fraud laws or policies, including, without limitation, we may block any transaction it determines to be, but not limited to, fraudulent or illegal activity or potentially fraudulent or illegal activity. We may withhold from our revenue sharing calculation any activity that we believe were due to any breach of the X User Agreement or that we believe may involve a violation of any law and/or any revenue generated from content from any blocked transactions. You may not participate in the Program if you are a person with whom U.S. persons are not permitted to have dealings pursuant to economic sanctions, including, without limitation, sanctions administered by the United States Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control or any other applicable sanctions authority (“**Prohibited Person**”). This includes, without limitation, persons located in, or a citizen of, or ordinarily resident in, the following countries and regions: Cuba, Iran, the Crimea Region of Ukraine, North Korea and Syria. You represent and warrant that you are not a Prohibited Person. You may not participate in the Program if you work for a government institution, are an elected official, are a political party, or engaged in any election-related activity.   

Violation of any of the above rules and restrictions may lead to termination of your participation in the Program and/or your eligibility to receive any share of the revenue. 

The creator revenue share payment is based on engagement from Premium users with your content on X. We reserve the right at any time to modify how our payment calculation is structured, including, for example, adding or removing revenue types, for any reason, including business, financial, or legal reasons. Please see the [Help Center](https://help.x.com/using-x/creator-revenue-sharing) for the most updated information. 

Payouts are paid net of any payment provider processing fees. If you are found to artificially inflate the number of views on your posts through promoted post, manual, automated, or other means, or manipulate the platform to alter the views on your posts, you will forfeit any amount due to you and you will be terminated from the Program. If at any point X finds content to be manipulated, including, for example using bots or other automated means, or artificially inflated, X reserves the right to adjust any future payments, or to suspend payment.

Balances accrue regularly, for example, on a daily basis. Payouts occur on a regular basis for, at most, the preceding 90 days. Once you earn more than the minimum amount set forth in the [Help Center](https://help.x.com/using-x/creator-revenue-sharing), you are entitled to transfer the money from your payment processor account into your external bank account. Accounts that fall below the impressions threshold will remain in the Program and will not be removed from the Program but funds accrued below the minimum amount set forth in the [Help Center](https://help.x.com/using-x/creator-revenue-sharing) will not be paid out.

X reserves the right to issue payouts to you at any cadence in its sole discretion, including for business, financial, or legal reasons.

X uses a third party payment processor (“**Payment Processor**”) to make its revenue share payments to you. To be part of the Program, you will first need to create an account with the Payment Processor who will require you to meet certain identity verification requirements, such as providing proof of identity and/or residence. If you provide the Payment Processor an address outside of the State of California, you verify that you perform the services under these Terms outside of the State of California. You will also be required to submit payment and tax information to the Payment Processor. If X or the Payment Processor determines as part of the payment onboarding process, or later, that payments cannot be made to you for any reason, you cannot be part of the Program. By accepting these Terms, you expressly authorize X to access data about your Payment Processor connected account activity and transactions and to conduct other activities in connection with the processing and monitoring of revenue share payments under these Terms. 

You are responsible for paying applicable Taxes (as defined below), if any, due to taxing authorities arising from, or in connection with, your receipt of any payment of a share of the revenue earned by you. X may deduct or withhold any Taxes that it may be legally obligated to deduct or withhold from any amounts payable to you, and payment to you as reduced by such deductions or withholdings will constitute full payment and settlement of the amounts payable under these Terms. Each party will provide the other party with any tax documentation reasonably necessary to make or receive payments hereunder. As used above, “**Taxes**” means any income, stamp, sales, use, value-added or other taxes, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings.

These Terms will commence on the date you click to accept these Terms (regardless of whether or not you are accepted into the Program) and will continue until terminated by either party as provided in this Agreement. You may opt out of participating in the Program at any time by providing written notice to X by writing to Paid Support [here](https://help.x.com/using-x/x-premium-faq). X may terminate these Terms, at any time, with or without cause, in X’s sole discretion, including, without limitation, if you misrepresent yourself or your account; violate these Terms, the X User Agreement, or any applicable laws; or no longer meet the eligibility requirements to participate in the Program.

In addition, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to: suspend, remove or disable access to your account or cease providing you with all or part of the Program; remove you from the Program; and/or withhold, suspend, recoup or set-off revenue share payments (including any amount that may have been attributable to or from past or future account) if we believe you or your account is in breach or violation of these Terms, the X User Agreement or any applicable laws. We will have no liability for taking any of the above actions.

Upon termination of these Terms and/or your participation in the Program: (a) the rights and obligations under these Terms will immediately cease, (b) any and all liabilities accrued before the effective date of the termination will survive, subject to the following: (i) if you have met the Minimum Payment Threshold at the time of termination of these Terms, the Payment Processor will attempt to pay you for amounts  and unpaid. If, however, the Payment Processor is unable to remit payment to you due to circumstances beyond its control, you will automatically forfeit all such amounts and X will not owe any and all such amounts; or (ii) if you have not yet met the Minimum Payment Threshold, no amounts will be paid or owed to you. 

  
During and after your participation in the Program, you shall not disclose any proprietary and/or non-public information of X provided to you or to which you have access in connection with the Program (“**Confidential** **Information**”), except as authorized in writing by X or as required by law or court order, provided: (a) you will promptly notify X in writing of the requirement for disclosure, and (b) disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information legally required. You shall promptly notify X of any actual or suspected misuse or unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information. Upon termination of these Terms and/or your participation in the Program, you will promptly destroy or erase any Confidential Information in your possession or control.

YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE PROGRAM AND SUBSCRIPTIONS (OR FEATURES THEREOF) MAY BE EXPERIMENTAL IN NATURE AND/OR IN A BETA PHASE AND AGREE THAT ACCESS TO AND/OR USE OF THE PROGRAM AND SUBSCRIPTIONS IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM AND SUBSCRIPTIONS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE,” WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. X CORP.

**THIS SECTION APPLIES TO YOU ONLY IF YOU LIVE IN THE UNITED STATES. PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.**

**a. General.** The following provisions are important with respect to the agreement between you and X regarding X’s features and services memorialized by these Terms. Subject to the provisions below, including exceptions set forth in this Section, you and X agree to arbitrate any disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating to these Terms and/or your participation in the Program (individually a “**Dispute**,” or more than one, “**Disputes**”).

**b. Initial Dispute Resolution.** Most disputes between you and X can be resolved informally. You may contact us by writing to Paid Support [here](https://help.x.com/using-x/x-premium-faq). When you contact us, please provide a brief description of the nature and bases for your concerns, your contact information, and the specific relief you seek. The parties shall use their best efforts through this support process to settle any Dispute other than an Exempted Dispute. You and we agree that good faith participation in this informal process is required and must be completed as set forth above before either party can initiate arbitration regarding any Dispute.

**c. BINDING ARBITRATION. If we cannot reach an agreed upon resolution with you regarding a Dispute within a period of thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution commences under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision above, then either you or we may initiate binding arbitration, which will be the sole means to resolve any Dispute, subject to the terms set forth below and except for claims brought in small claims court or Exempted Disputes, unless you opt out. Specifically, all Disputes shall be finally resolved exclusively through binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in New York, NY, and through a single mutually agreed upon arbitrator, in accordance with the provisions of the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules, available at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/) or by calling the AAA at 1.800.778.7879, except as provided below. YOU AND X HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR JUDGE, EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO EXEMPTED DISPUTES.**

**Except with respect to Exempted Disputes, the arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable, or whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity, provided that such relief (including injunctive relief) is limited to your individual circumstances. Notwithstanding the requirements of this arbitration provision, if the Dispute involves a claim for public injunctive relief, you may choose to sever that claim from the arbitration proceeding and bring it in any court of proper jurisdiction. The arbitrator’s award shall be written and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.**

**YOU HAVE ONE YEAR TO BRING A CLAIM AGAINST X.** You must bring any claim against X arising out of or related to these Terms within one (1) year after the date of the occurrence of the event or facts giving rise to the dispute, unless applicable law provides that the normal statute of limitations for that claim may not be shortened by agreement. If you do not bring a claim within this period, you forever waive the right to pursue any claim or cause of action, of any kind or character, based on such events or facts, and such claims or causes of action are permanently banned, and X will have no liability with respect to such claim.

**d. Filing Process and Costs.** To start an arbitration, you can get submission instructions at: [https://adr.org/Support](https://adr.org/Support). X will pay the consumer’s initial filing fee of $200, however notwithstanding any rules of the AAA to the contrary, the parties agree to share equally all other costs of the arbitration, including the arbitrator's fees and expenses, except to the extent required by law. The arbitrator (and not AAA) shall have the sole authority to determine any disputes that arise concerning the allocation of costs and expenses, including the fees and expenses of the arbitrator. If the arbitrator determines that claims were filed for the purposes of harassment or were patently frivolous, the arbitrator can reallocate the arbitrator’s compensation and administrative fees, including the filing and hearing fees, as set forth in the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules. The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.

**e. Location.** Arbitration will take place on a documents-only basis or you can choose to conduct the proceedings by telephone, video, or in-person. For in-person arbitration, the proceedings will be in the city or county where you reside or, if you do not reside in the United States, in the State of New York, County of New York.

**f. Class Action Waiver.** To the extent permitted by law, you also waive the right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action, collective action or representative action proceeding.

**g. Severability.** If it is determined that any part of this Dispute Resolution Agreement cannot be enforced as to a particular claim for relief or remedy (such as injunctive relief), then that claim or remedy (and only that claim or remedy) shall be severed and must be brought in a court of proper jurisdiction and any other claims must be arbitrated.

**h. Exception - Exempted Disputes and Small Claims Court Claims - Forum Selection.** Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all other Disputes through arbitration, any disputes, claims, or controversies arising from fraud (“**Exempted Disputes**”) shall be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in New York County, New York, United States, and you consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum. Without prejudice to, and notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that, in its sole discretion, X may bring any Exempted Dispute we have against you in any competent court in the United States.

**j. Changes to this Section.** We will provide 30-days’ notice of any material change to this Dispute Resolution Agreement. Changes will become effective on the 30th day, and will apply prospectively only to any claims arising after the 30th day.

**k. Choice of Law.** THESE TERMS MEMORIALIZE A TRANSACTION IN INTERSTATE COMMERCE. THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT AND INTERPRETING CASE LAW GOVERN THE INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS, WITHOUT REGARD TO STATE LAW.

**l. Survival.** This Dispute Resolution Agreement survives the end of the relationship between you and X, including cancellation of or unsubscribing from any services or communications provided by X.

We reserve the right to modify these Terms, from time to time. We will notify you of material revisions, for example via a service notification or an email to the email associated with your account.
