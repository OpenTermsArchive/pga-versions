Term; Subscription Fees; Payment; Suspension, and Termination.** **A. Term.** The term of this Agreement will start on the date (i) you accept the terms herein or (ii) start accessing or using any of the Licensed Material, whichever is earlier, and will continue until you stop accessing and using the Licensed Material unless terminated earlier as described below. **B. Subscription Terms.** Paid Services provided as part of the Licensed Material are made available as a recurring subscription service that provides access to certain features, benefits, or services, as described on the Developer Site and the Payment Portal. If you purchase a Paid Service, you do so by paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis in accordance with the payment terms set forth below. When you subscribe to access the Paid Service(s) via the Payment Portal, you expressly agree that you are authorizing recurring payments and that payments will be made by the payment method you have selected until the applicable Paid Service is canceled by you or by X or this Agreement is otherwise terminated. Your subscription to the Paid Service will automatically renew monthly until canceled in accordance with this Agreement. Your payment information will be automatically processed by the Payment Processor (as defined below) at the start of each subscription period applicable to the Paid Service(s). If your payment information is declined, your subscription may be canceled until you provide new payment information for the applicable Paid Service(s). If you provide new payment information and your payment account is successfully charged, your new subscription period will be based on the original renewal date and not the date the successful charge took place. Prices for Paid Services are subject to change from time to time. X will provide reasonable advance notice of any material change to the price of Paid Services, which notice may be provided via the Developer Site. For subscription fees, price changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. If you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by canceling your subscription to the applicable Paid Service(s) prior to the price change going into effect. **C. Payment Terms.** X may offer payment options that vary by Paid Service, device, operating system, geographic location, or other factors, which may be updated from time to time. These payment options may include web payments using a third party payment processor (“**Payment Processor**”). When you access a Paid Service, you agree: (i) to pay the price listed for the Paid Service, along with any additional amounts relating to applicable taxes, surcharges, credit card fees, bank fees, foreign transaction fees, foreign exchange fees, and currency fluctuations, on a recurring basis during the applicable subscription period; and (ii) to abide by any applicable terms of service, privacy policies, or other legal agreements or restrictions (including additional age restrictions) imposed by the Payment Processor in connection with your use of a given payment method. The subscription fee will automatically be applied at the start of the renewal period for the applicable subscription period unless you cancel the Paid Service(s) on the Developer Site. It is your responsibility to make sure your banking, credit card, debit card, and/or other payment information is up to date, complete, and accurate at all times. If you make a payment for a Paid Service through a Payment Processor, X may receive information about your transaction such as when it was made, when a subscription is set to expire or auto- renew, what platform you made the purchase on, and other information. X will not be liable for any errors made or delays by the Payment Processor, your bank, your credit card company, or any payment network. All payments to X are non-refundable except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or as required by law. **D. Taxes and fees.** All fees exclude any and all taxes and similar fees now in force, enacted, or imposed in the future on the transaction, delivery of the Licensed Material, or the delivery of the X Content including any sales, use or value added taxes, goods and services tax, consumption tax, customs duties, tariffs, or similar charges. These taxes may include but are not limited to, VAT, GST, sales tax, withholding tax, and any other applicable taxes but exclude taxes solely based on X’s net income. You are responsible for the payment of all such taxes, duties, and charges and any related penalties and interest arising from the payment of such amounts. In addition, a surcharge may be charged to recover costs associated with Digital Services Tax (“DST”) or similar jurisdiction-specific taxes or regulatory fees incurred by X in certain jurisdictions. This surcharge will appear as a separate line item on your invoice, where applicable, and will be calculated as a percentage of applicable charges as determined by X in its sole discretion. X may adjust this surcharge at any time, without prior notice, in response to increased tax or fee rates or related administrative costs. Depending on your location, X may be responsible for collecting and reporting information related to transaction taxes arising from your purchase of Paid Services. You grant X permission to provide your account and personal information to relevant tax authorities to fulfill our tax collection and reporting obligations. **E. Canceling Your Subscription for Paid Services.** Your subscription for Paid Services will automatically renew monthly unless you cancel your subscription at least 24 hours before the end of your current subscription period. There are no refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods, including in a situation where certain features, benefits, and/or services are modified or discontinued. SUBSCRIPTION PLANS ARE PREPAID, NON-REFUNDABLE (UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW), AND AUTOMATICALLY RENEW AT THE END OF EACH SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD UNLESS THE SUBSCRIPTION IS CANCELED FOLLOWING THE CANCELLATION PROCEDURES HEREIN. You may cancel your subscription for Paid Services at any time via the Developer Site and you will no longer have access to the Paid Services (or any features or functionality thereof) at the end of your then-current subscription term. When you cancel the Paid Services, your subscription will remain active from the time you cancel until the end of your current subscription period. You will not receive a refund or credit for any remaining days in your current subscription period unless required by law. All payments for Paid Services are final and not refundable or exchangeable except as required by applicable law. X makes no guarantee as to the nature, quality, or value of a Paid Service or the availability or supply thereof. Refunds or credits are not provided for any unused or partially used Paid Service (for example, a partially used subscription period). **All transactions are final** unless you have a right to withdraw pursuant to law, such as provided below\*\*.\*\*

1.  **Withdrawal Right & Refunds for Users Living in EU or UK.** When you purchase any Paid Services on subscription, you expressly agree to do so on a subscription basis and that the subscription will commence immediately on your date of purchase. If you are a consumer in an EU Member State or the UK, you agree you have fourteen (14) days after your purchase to withdraw from your contract for purchase for any reason.
2.  **No Withdrawal Right for Users Living in Taiwan.** When you purchase Paid Services, you do so on a subscription basis, the subscription will commence immediately on your date of purchase, and the Paid Service is fully performed once started. If you are a consumer in Taiwan, you agree that you can cancel your subscription for any Paid Services in accordance with Section VII.E above, but that there is otherwise no right to rescind your subscription and no refund will be issued.

**F. Paid Services Are Non-Transferable between X Accounts.** Each purchase of a Paid Service applies to a single X account, meaning that your purchase will apply solely to the account you were using when you purchased the Paid Service and will not apply to other accounts that you may have access to or control over. If you have or control multiple accounts and you want access to Paid Services on each account, you must purchase the Paid Service on each account individually. You may not allow others to use your X account to access any Licensed Material that such person did not order. You may not purchase a Paid Service or use any Licensed Material if you are a person with whom U.S. persons are not permitted to have dealings pursuant to economic sanctions, including, without limitation, sanctions administered by the United States Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control or any other applicable sanctions authority (“**Prohibited Person**”). This includes, without limitation, persons located in, a citizen of, or ordinarily resident in the following countries and regions: Cuba, Iran, the Crimea Region of Ukraine, North Korea and Syria. You represent and warrant that you are not a Prohibited Person. **G. Restrictions and Obligations.** You may only purchase and use a Paid Service or use the Licensed Material if you are legally allowed to use the Licensed Material in your country and you live in a country supported by X for the applicable Paid Service or Licensed Material. X may, in its discretion, restrict the ability to access the Licensed Material or purchase a Paid Service in certain countries. X reserves the right to modify the list of supported countries from time to time. X reserves the right to refuse Paid Services transactions or to cancel or discontinue the sale or use of a Paid Service or the use of any Licensed Material in its sole discretion. **H. Suspension.** X may suspend your use of and access to the Licensed Material immediately without notice (a) if X reasonably believes that (i) your use of the Licensed Material would cause damage to, or an inordinate burden upon, the Licensed Material, (ii) you have violated this Agreement, (iii) you create risk or possible legal exposure for X, (iv) X’s provision of the Licensed Material to you is no longer commercially viable; (b) for prolonged inactivity; (c) if X is requested or directed to do so by any competent court of law, regulatory authority, or law enforcement agency; or (d) for failure to pay for the Paid Services. X will not be liable for damages of any sort that result from any such suspension. **I. Termination.** X may terminate this Agreement for any reason at X’s sole discretion. Except where such early termination is the result of your breach of this Agreement, such early termination by X shall be effective at the end of the then-current subscription period. If you violate the terms of this Agreement, X may terminate this Agreement for cause immediately upon notice to you and you will not receive a prorated refund for any Paid Services. You may cancel your subscription for the Paid Services or your use of the Licensed Material on the Developer Site. Upon termination of this Agreement: (a) all licenses granted in this Agreement immediately expire and you must cease use of any Licensed Material; and (b) you shall permanently delete all Licensed Material in all forms and types of media, and copies thereof, in your possession. Upon the request of X for any reason, you will promptly (and in any event within ten (10) business days of such request) provide evidence (e.g., screenshots of deletion confirmation) of compliance with the provisions of the aforementioned subpart (b) of this Section. The parties to this Agreement will not be liable to each other for any damages resulting solely from termination of this Agreement as permitted under this Agreement. **VIII. Compliance Audit.** X or a mutually agreed upon third party agent subject to obligations of confidentiality will be entitled to inspect and audit any records related to the performance of this Agreement in your control or possession upon reasonable notice to you, and at a reasonable time during normal business hours, for the purpose of verifying compliance with this Agreement and the fees payable to X for the two (2) year period preceding the audit. X may exercise its audit right no more than once every twelve (12) months unless it has reasonable cause for noncompliance, and such audit shall not unreasonably interfere with your business activities. You will provide your full cooperation and assistance with such audit and provide access to all Licensed Material in your possession, applicable agreements, and records. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as part of the audit, X may request, and you agree to provide, a written report, signed by an authorized representative, listing your then-current deployment of the Licensed Material. You will pay X within thirty (30) business days after the completion of the audit the amount of any underpayment revealed by any such audit. In addition, if any such audit reveals an underpayment by you of five percent (5%) or more, then you will also reimburse X for the reasonable costs and expenses of such audit. The requirements of this Section will survive for one (1) year following the termination of this Agreement. **IX. Disclaimer.** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE LICENSED MATERIAL IS PROVIDED TO YOU “AS IS”, “WHERE IS”, WITH ALL FAULTS, AND X DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NONINFRINGEMENT, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.

YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL AND ANY CONTENT YOU PROVIDE. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY MAY NOT BE VALID IN SOME JURISDICTIONS AND YOU MAY HAVE WARRANTY RIGHTS UNDER LAW WHICH MAY NOT BE WAIVED OR DISCLAIMED. **FURTHER YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THE PAID SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO YOU ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS.** **X. Indemnification.** You shall defend X against any and all proceedings, demands, claims, and suits (including without limitation product liability claims), and indemnify X from any and all liabilities, damages, and costs (including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees) to the extent arising out of (a) your use of the Licensed Material in any manner that is inconsistent with this Agreement or (b) the performance, promotion, sale, or distribution of your Services. If X seeks indemnification or defense from you under this Section, X will promptly notify you in writing of the claim(s) brought against X for which it seeks indemnification or defense. X may assume full control of the defense of claims with legal counsel of its choice. You shall not enter into any third-party agreement that would affect the rights of X, constitute an admission of fault by X, or bind X in any manner without the prior written consent of X. If X assumes control of the defense of such claim, X shall not settle any such claim requiring payment from you without your prior written approval. **XI. Limitation of Liability.** IN NO EVENT WILL X BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY USERS FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY LOSS OF OR DAMAGE TO USE, DATA, BUSINESS, GOODWILL OR PROFITS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT. IN ANY CASE, X’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED FIFTY DOLLARS ($50.00). THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS SHALL APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED UPON CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT X HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE. IF APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS ANY LIMITATION ON LIABILITY HEREIN, THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE LIMITATION WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MODIFIED TO CONFORM TO APPLICABLE LAW. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITIES SET FORTH HEREIN ARE AGREED ALLOCATIONS OF RISK AND SUCH LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY. **XII.

The changes will not be retroactive and the most current version of this Agreement, available at the Developer Site, will govern your access to and use of the Licensed Material and any corresponding transactions. Your continued access or use of the Licensed Material will constitute binding acceptance of such updates and modifications. **XIII. Dispute Resolution and Class Action Waiver.** **A. THIS SECTION APPLIES TO YOU ONLY IF YOU LIVE OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION, EFTA STATES, OR THE UNITED KINGDOM, INCLUDING IF YOU LIVE IN THE UNITED STATES. PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.**

1.  **Choice of Law and Forum Selection.** The laws of the State of Texas, excluding its choice of law provisions, will govern this Agreement and any dispute that arises between you and X, notwithstanding any other agreement between the parties to the contrary. All disputes related to this Agreement, including any disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the marketing of the Licensed Material, and/or your participation in the Licensed Material will be brought exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas or state courts located in Tarrant County, Texas, United States, and you consent to personal jurisdiction in those forums and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum. Without prejudice to the foregoing, you agree that, in its sole discretion, X may bring any claim, cause of action, or dispute it has against you in any competent court in the country in which you reside that has jurisdiction and venue over the claim.

Developer Policy
------------------

### 

X + Developers

X loves developers. We’re delighted and amazed by the tools and services this community creates by harnessing the power of X data. As part of our commitment to this community, we aim to provide data access that is open and fair for developers, safe for people on X, and beneficial for the X platform as a whole. To further these goals we’ve crafted the Developer Policy as a guide to help people understand our rules and expectations about appropriate API and X Content usage. This Developer Policy (“**Policy**”) provides rules and guidelines for developers who interact with X’s ecosystem of applications, services, website, web pages and content. It is part of your contract with X governing access to and use of the X API and X Content (either as part of the Developer Agreement or other written agreement with X). Policy violations are considered violations of your agreement. This Policy may be changed from time to time without notice. Capitalized terms used in this Policy, which are not defined in this Policy, will have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the or the Master License Agreement.

### 

Using this policy

We’ve structured this policy to make it as easy to follow as possible. Please keep information from the following policy sections top of mind as you use the X API and X Content:

1.  **Set Yourself Up for Success** - You are responsible for complying with all X policies. It’s important that you review and understand this Policy, as well as the policies we link to in this document, before you access the X API and X Content. The time spent reviewing our policies may save you hours of rework down the road.
2.  **Privacy and Control are Essential** - Protecting and defending the privacy of people on X is built into the core DNA of our company. As such, we prohibit the use of X data in any way that would be inconsistent with people’s reasonable expectations of privacy. By building on the X API or accessing X Content, you have a special role to play in safeguarding this commitment, most importantly by respecting people’s privacy and providing them with transparency and control over how their data is used.
3.  **Follow the Platform Usage Guidelines** - Getting approved to access the X API and X Content is just the first step. Our Platform Usage Guidelines should be your first stop anytime you have questions about how to ensure policy compliance for your planned use of the X platform.

We’ve provided a lot more detail on what each of these three key sections mean below. Please review them carefully to ensure that your usage of the X API and X Content is consistent with our policies. If we believe you are in violation of this Policy (or any other X policy), we may suspend or permanently revoke your access to the X API and X Content. Finally, please note that X may monitor your use of the X API to improve the X Applications, to examine any commercial use, and to ensure your compliance with your approved use case and this Policy. Thanks for reading, and thank you for building with us! We look forward to seeing what you create!

### 

Set yourself up for success

You can avoid many potential pitfalls while using the X API by ensuring that your service has been built the right way from day 1. This section of the Developer Policy contains rules that all developers must follow before using the X API or X Content. The Free, Basic, and Pro plans (as described at ) are designed for hobbyists, commercial prototyping, early-stage X product integrations, and supporting applications with limited end-users. If you use the X API and X Content beyond this scope, then you must apply (or already subscribe to) an Enterprise plan (as described at ). **We review all proposed uses of the X developer platform to verify policy compliance — so you’re required to disclose (and update, as applicable) your planned use of the X API and X Content in order to be granted and to maintain access.** All new developers must to access the X API. Current developers without an approved developer account must apply for one as directed to do so by X. As part of this process, you’ll need to provide us with a written description of your intended uses of the X API and X Content. Your use case description is binding on you, and any substantive deviation from it may constitute a violation of our rules and result in enforcement action. You must notify us of any substantive modification to your use case and receive approval before you may begin using X Content for that new purpose. Failure to do so may result in suspension and termination of your API and data access. **By building on the X API or accessing X Content, you must comply with ALL X policies.** These include this , the , the , the , the , and the , as well as any other agreements you enter into with X relating to your use of the X API or X Content, including but not limited to the or a Master Licensing Agreement or Order (as applicable). You must also comply with any modifications to these policies and any new policies launched by X. It is your responsibility to monitor the use of your service and to design your service to prevent violations of X policy by people who use it. Failure to do so may result in suspension or termination of your API and X Content access. **You may not register multiple applications for a single use case or substantially similar or overlapping use cases.** In this context, a “use case” is a consistent set of analyses, displays, or actions performed via an application. “White label” versions of a tool or service are not permissible. If you plan to “white label” versions of your application, you must notify and receive separate approval from us. _As a single exception to these rules,_ you may create and use a maximum of 3 applications for development, staging, and production instances of the same service. These apps must be registered to a single account, and should be clearly identified (in the name and description) as dev, staging, and prod instances of a single service. **You may not use development or staging applications for production purposes.** **You must keep all API keys or other access credentials private.** You may not use, and may not encourage or facilitate others to use, API keys or other access credentials owned by others. **Your license agreement with X limits your use of the X API and X Content. Among other things, the X API has rate limits which help to ensure fair data usage and to combat spam on the platform.** You may not exceed or circumvent rate limits, or any other limitations or restrictions described in this Policy or your agreement with X, listed on the , or communicated to you by X. **You may not remove or alter any proprietary notices or marks on X Content received via the X API.** This helps to make sure that people know where X Content is coming from, and who it belongs to. **For data integrity and platform health reasons, you may not interfere with, intercept, disrupt, or disable any features of the X API or the X service.** In other words, use the APIs as intended and documented on . Refer to our for more details about acceptable use.

### 

Privacy and control are essential

X takes privacy seriously, and we expect everyone using X Content and the X API to do the same. Any use of the X developer platform, X API, or X Content in a manner that is inconsistent with peoples’ reasonable expectations of privacy may be subject to enforcement action, which can include suspension and termination of API and X Content access. Your commitment to privacy and control must extend to all uses of X Content and all aspects of the service that you build using our API. To that end, the people using your service must understand and consent to how you use their data, and how you access X on their behalf. This can be accomplished through providing people with a clear, comprehensive, and transparent privacy policy, as well as ensuring that you get express and informed consent from each person using your service before taking any action on their behalf. **Please note that a person authenticating into your service does not by itself constitute consent.**

### 

Consent & permissions

**In particular, you must get express and informed consent from people before doing any of the following:**

*   Taking _any_ actions on their behalf. This includes (but is not limited to):
    *   Posting content to X
    *   Following/unfollowing accounts
    *   Modifying profile or account information
    *   Adding hashtags or any other content to Posts
*   Republishing content accessed by means other than via the X API or other X tools
*   Using someone’s X Content to promote a product or service
*   Storing non-public content such as Direct Messages (DMs), or any other private or confidential information
*   Sharing or publishing protected content, or any other private or confidential information

**If your service allows people to post content to X you must do the following before publishing:**

*   Show exactly what will be published
*   Make it clear to people using your service what geo information (if any) will be added to the content

**If your service allows people to post content to both your service and X, you must do the following before publishing:**

*   Obtain permission to post the content
*   Explain where you will post the content

**You must respect the protected and blocked status of all X Content. You may not serve content obtained using one person’s authentication token to a different person who is not authorized to view that content.**

*   **Protected accounts:** A ’s content is only available to people who have been approved by the owner to follow that account. So, if you run a service that accesses protected accounts, you may only do so to serve such content to the specific people with permission to view that content.
*   **Blocked accounts:** People on X are able to access to their accounts for any reason they choose. Commingling information obtained from tokens (or any other API-based action) to bypass this choice is not permitted.

**As Direct Messages (DMs) are non-public in nature, services that provide DM features must take extra steps to safeguard personal privacy. You may not serve DM content to people who are not authorized to view that content. If your service provides DM functionality you must also:**

*   Notify people if you send read receipt events for DMs. You can do this by providing a notice directly in your service, or by displaying read receipts from other participants in a conversation.
*   Get consent before configuring media to be sent in a DM as “shared” (i.e. reusable across multiple DMs). If you do allow media in a DM to be “shared,” you must provide a clear notice that this content will be accessible to anyone with the media’s URL.

### 

Content compliance

**If you store X Content offline, you must keep it up to date with the current state of that content on X.** Specifically, you must delete or modify any content you have if it is deleted or modified on X. This must be done as soon as reasonably possible, or within 24 hours after receiving a request to do so by X or the applicable X account owner, or as otherwise required by your agreement with X or applicable law. This must be done unless otherwise prohibited by law, and only then with the express written permission of X. Modified content can take various forms. This includes (but is not limited to):

*   Content that has been made private or gained protected status
*   Content that has been suspended from the platform
*   Content that has had geotags removed from it
*   Content that has been withheld or removed from X

### 

Off-X matching

**We limit the circumstances under which you may match a person on X to information obtained or stored off-X.** Off-X matching involves associating X Content, including a X @handle or user ID, with a person, household, device, browser, or other off-X identifier. You may only do this if you have express opt-in consent from the person before making the association, or as described below. In situations in which you don’t have a person’s express, opt-in consent to link their Xidentity to an off-X identifier, we require that any connection you draw be based only on information that someone would reasonably expect to be used for that purpose. In addition, absent a person’s express opt-in consent you may only attempt to match your records about someone to a X identity based on:

*   **Information provided directly to you by the person.** Note that records about individuals with whom you have no prior relationship, including data about individuals obtained from third parties, do not meet this standard; and/or
*   **Public data.** “Public data” in this context refers to:
    *   Information about a person that you obtained from a public, generally-available resource (such as a directory of members of a professional association)
    *   Information on X about a person that is publicly available, including:
        *   Posts
        *   Profile information, including an account bio and publicly-stated location
        *   Display name and @handle

### 

Your privacy policy

**You must display your service’s privacy policy to people before they are permitted to download, install, or sign up to your service.** It must disclose at least the following information:

*   The information that you collect from people who use your service
*   How you use and share that information (including with X)
*   How people can contact you with inquiries and requests regarding their information

Your privacy policy must be consistent with all applicable laws, and be no less protective of people than and the . You must cease your access to the X API and the use of all X Content if you are unable to comply with your and/or X’s Privacy Policy.

### 

Using geo-data

**Use of geo data comes with additional restrictions due to the sensitive nature of this information.** If your service adds location information to Posts, you must disclose to people:

*   When you add location information
*   Whether you add location information as a geotag or annotations data
*   Whether your location information is listed as a place, or as geographic coordinates

If your application allows people to post with their location you must comply with X’s in full. **Any use of location data or geographic information on a standalone basis is prohibited.** You may not (and may not permit others to) store, aggregate, or cache location data and other geographic information contained in X Content, except as part of a Post. For example, you may not separate location data or geographic information out from Posts to show where individuals have been over time. Heat maps and related tools that show aggregated geo activity (e.g., the number of people in a city using a hashtag) are permitted.

### 

X passwords

**You may not store X passwords, or request that people provide their X password, account credentials, or developer application information (including consumer key) to you directly.** We suggest the use of as the authentication tool to link your service and people on X.

### 

Platform usage guidelines

Have you taken care to review X’s policies and set up your API access the right way? Does your service follow X’s privacy and control guidelines? If you can answer yes to these two questions, then you are ready to start using the X API and X Content. X’s Platform Usage Guidelines provide the assistance needed to ensure that your use of X Content is compliant from day 1 throughout the lifecycle of your service. We suggest reviewing these rules on a regular basis to make sure that your integration is operating in a way that is safe and beneficial to people on X and the X platform as a whole.

### 

Spam, bots, and automation

**The use of the X API and developer products to create spam, or engage in any form of platform manipulation, is prohibited.** You should review the X Rules on , and ensure that your service does not, and does not enable people to, violate our policies. **Services that perform write actions, including posting Posts, following accounts, or sending Direct Messages, must follow the .** In particular, you should:

*   Always get explicit consent before sending people
*   Immediately respect requests to opt-out of being contacted by you
*   Never perform bulk, aggressive, or spammy actions, including
*   Never post identical or substantially similar content across

**If you’re operating an API-based bot account you must clearly indicate what the account is and who is responsible for it.** You should never mislead or confuse people about whether your account is or is not a bot. A good way to do this is by including a statement that the account is a bot in the profile bio.

### 

X performance benchmarking

**You may not use the X API to measure the availability, performance, functionality, or usage of X for benchmarking, competitive, or commercial purposes.** For example, you should never use the X API to:

*   Calculate aggregate X metrics, such as the total number of Monthly Actives (MAs) or Daily Actives (DAs)
*   Calculate aggregate X Post metrics, such as the total number of Posts posted per day, or the number of account engagements
*   Measure or analyze the responsiveness of X
*   Measure or analyze spam or security on X, except as permitted below

**We support research that helps improve conversational health on X.** You may not publicly disclose any research or findings concerning, or develop, create, or offer services using, the X API or X Content that measure, analyze, or attempt to identify behaviors or content which violate X policies without express written permission from X. **DSA Researchers:** If you need to contact X relating to access under Art. 40 of the Digital Services Act, please contact . If you wish to apply for researcher access, please submit an .

### 

Public display of Posts

**You must maintain the integrity of all X Content that you display publicly or to people who use your service.** If you don’t use to display content, then you must use the X API to retrieve the most current version available for display. If displayed content ceases to be available through the X API, then you must remove it from your service as soon as reasonably possible, or within 24 hours after the receipt of a removal request from X, or the applicable X account owner, or as otherwise required by applicable law. **There are specific rules you must follow if you display X Content offline.** Follow the for using Posts in broadcast if you display Posts offline. **If you embed or display Posts, you must contact us about your X API access if your site exceeds 10 million daily impressions.** X reserves the right to require additional terms as a condition to your use of the X API. Additional restrictions on X for Websites developer use include:

*   **Embedded Posts and/or embedded timelines**
    *   You must provide people with legally sufficient notice that fully discloses X’s collection and use of data about browsing activities on your website, including for interest-based advertising and personalization. You must also obtain legally sufficient consent from people for such collection and use
    *   You must provide legally sufficient instructions on how people can opt out of X’s interest-based advertising and personalization as described
*   **X for Websites widgets**
    *   You must ensure that people are provided with clear and comprehensive information about, and consent to, the storing and accessing of cookies or other information on their devices as described in X’s , where providing such information and obtaining such consent is required by law
*   **Services targeted to children under 13**
    *   Services targeted to children under 13 must opt out of tailoring X in any embedded Post and/or embedded timelines by setting the opt-out parameter to be ‘true’ as described

### 

Content redistribution

**The best place to get X Content is directly from X. Consequently, we restrict the redistribution of X Content to third parties.** If you provide X Content to third parties, including downloadable datasets or via an API, you may only distribute Post IDs, Direct Message IDs, and/or User IDs (except as described below). In total, you may not distribute more than 1,500,000 Post IDs to any entity (inclusive of multiple individuals associated with a single entity) within any 30 day period unless you have received written permission from X. In addition, developers may provide up to 500 public Posts Objects and/or User Objects to each person who uses your service on a daily basis if this is done via non-automated means (e.g., download of spreadsheets or PDFs). Academic researchers are permitted to distribute Post IDs and/or User IDs solely for the purposes of non-commercial research on behalf of an academic institution, and that has been approved by X in writing, or peer review or validation of such research. Only as many Post IDs or User IDs that is necessary for such research, and has been approved by X may be used. Any X Content provided to third parties remains subject to this Policy, and those third parties must agree to the X , , , and before receiving such downloads. You may not enable any entity to circumvent any other limitations or restrictions on the distribution of X Content as contained in this , the , or any other agreement with X. **Note:** This Section does not apply to researchers with X API access via Art. 40 of the EU Digital Services Act (2022) (“**DSA**”), who are instead subject to the procedures and restrictions set forth in the DSA and the Developer Agreement.

### 

Pay to engage

**Your service shouldn’t compensate people to take actions on X, as that results in inauthentic engagement that degrades the health of the platform.** As you use the X API you may not sell or receive monetary or virtual compensation for any X actions. This includes, but is not limited to, Posts, follows, unfollows, reposts, likes, comments, and replies.

### 

Service authenticity

**You must clearly identify your service so that people can understand its source and purpose.** Don’t use names, logos, or URLs that mask your service’s identity and features, or that falsely imply an affiliation with X or third parties. Note that creating applications for the purpose of selling names, or to prevent others from using names, is prohibited. **You may not use any URL (including shortened URLs) for your service that directs people to:**

*   A site that is unrelated to your service
*   A spam or malware site
*   A site that encourages people to violate X policy

### 

X name, logo, and likeness

**You may only use and display the X name and logo to identify X as the source of X Content.** You should never use the X name and logo, the X Official Partner Program badge, or any other similar marks or names in a manner that creates a false sense of endorsement, sponsorship, or association with X. The X contain detailed information to help you use the X brand in the right way. **You may only use the X Verified Account badge and any other enhanced account categorization as it is reported to you by X through the API.** This helps people know that the content your service displays is equivalent to that shown on X.

### 

Advertising on X

**There are restrictions regarding how and where you are allowed to advertise around X Content.** To start, your advertisements can’t resemble or reasonably be confused by people as a Post. Other rules on advertising include:

*   **There must be a clear separation between X Content and your advertisements.** You may not place any advertisements within the X timeline other than X Ads.
*   **X reserves the right to serve advertising via the X API.** If you decide to serve X Ads once we start delivering them via the API, we will share a portion of advertising revenue with you in accordance with the relevant terms and conditions.
*   **You may not use X Content, or information obtained from the X API to target people with advertising outside of the X platform.**

The following additional rules apply for any use of the X services or features listed below:

### 

X Login

**You must present people with easy to find options to log into and out of X, for example via the OAuth protocol.** The _Sign in with X_ option must be displayed at least as prominently as any other sign-up or sign-in feature on your service. You must also provide people without a X account the opportunity to create one via X. **Once someone on your service authenticates via _Sign in with X_ you must clearly display their X identity.** X identity includes the person’s current X @handle, avatar, and X logo. Any display of someone’s X followers on your service must clearly show that the relationship is associated with X.

### 

X Cards

**To ensure a quality experience you must develop your Card to render across all platforms where Cards are displayed.** Additional rules that you must follow when using Cards include:

*   You must mark your Post as ‘true’ for sensitive media if you plan to display such media within a Card
*   You must use HTTPS for hosting all assets within your Card. Your Card should never generate active mixed content browser warnings

X Developer Policy
==================

X + Developers
----------------

X loves developers. We’re delighted and amazed by the tools and services this community creates by harnessing the power of X data. As part of our commitment to this community, we aim to provide data access that is open and fair for developers, safe for people on X, and beneficial for the X platform as a whole. To further these goals we’ve crafted the Developer Policy as a guide to help people understand our rules and expectations about appropriate API and X Content usage. This Developer Policy (“**Policy**”) provides rules and guidelines for developers who interact with X’s ecosystem of applications, services, website, web pages and content. It is part of your contract with X governing access to and use of the X API and X Content (either as part of the Developer Agreement or other written agreement with X). Policy violations are considered violations of your agreement. This Policy may be changed from time to time without notice. Capitalized terms used in this Policy, which are not defined in this Policy, will have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the or the Master License Agreement.

Using this policy
-------------------

We’ve structured this policy to make it as easy to follow as possible. Please keep information from the following policy sections top of mind as you use the X API and X Content:

1.  **Set Yourself Up for Success** - You are responsible for complying with all X policies. It’s important that you review and understand this Policy, as well as the policies we link to in this document, before you access the X API and X Content. The time spent reviewing our policies may save you hours of rework down the road.
2.  **Privacy and Control are Essential** - Protecting and defending the privacy of people on X is built into the core DNA of our company. As such, we prohibit the use of X data in any way that would be inconsistent with people’s reasonable expectations of privacy. By building on the X API or accessing X Content, you have a special role to play in safeguarding this commitment, most importantly by respecting people’s privacy and providing them with transparency and control over how their data is used.
3.  **Follow the Platform Usage Guidelines** - Getting approved to access the X API and X Content is just the first step. Our Platform Usage Guidelines should be your first stop anytime you have questions about how to ensure policy compliance for your planned use of the X platform.

We’ve provided a lot more detail on what each of these three key sections mean below. Please review them carefully to ensure that your usage of the X API and X Content is consistent with our policies. If we believe you are in violation of this Policy (or any other X policy), we may suspend or permanently revoke your access to the X API and X Content. Finally, please note that X may monitor your use of the X API to improve the X Applications, to examine any commercial use, and to ensure your compliance with your approved use case and this Policy. Thanks for reading, and thank you for building with us! We look forward to seeing what you create!

Set yourself up for success
-----------------------------

You can avoid many potential pitfalls while using the X API by ensuring that your service has been built the right way from day 1. This section of the Developer Policy contains rules that all developers must follow before using the X API or X Content. The Free, Basic, and Pro plans (as described at ) are designed for hobbyists, commercial prototyping, early-stage X product integrations, and supporting applications with limited end-users. If you use the X API and X Content beyond this scope, then you must apply (or already subscribe to) an Enterprise plan (as described at ). **We review all proposed uses of the X developer platform to verify policy compliance — so you’re required to disclose (and update, as applicable) your planned use of the X API and X Content in order to be granted and to maintain access.** All new developers must to access the X API. Current developers without an approved developer account must apply for one as directed to do so by X. As part of this process, you’ll need to provide us with a written description of your intended uses of the X API and X Content. Your use case description is binding on you, and any substantive deviation from it may constitute a violation of our rules and result in enforcement action. You must notify us of any substantive modification to your use case and receive approval before you may begin using X Content for that new purpose. Failure to do so may result in suspension and termination of your API and data access. **By building on the X API or accessing X Content, you must comply with ALL X policies.** These include this , the , the , the , the , and the , as well as any other agreements you enter into with X relating to your use of the X API or X Content, including but not limited to the or a Master Licensing Agreement or Order (as applicable). You must also comply with any modifications to these policies and any new policies launched by X. It is your responsibility to monitor the use of your service and to design your service to prevent violations of X policy by people who use it. Failure to do so may result in suspension or termination of your API and X Content access. **You may not register multiple applications for a single use case or substantially similar or overlapping use cases.** In this context, a “use case” is a consistent set of analyses, displays, or actions performed via an application. “White label” versions of a tool or service are not permissible. If you plan to “white label” versions of your application, you must notify and receive separate approval from us. _As a single exception to these rules,_ you may create and use a maximum of 3 applications for development, staging, and production instances of the same service. These apps must be registered to a single account, and should be clearly identified (in the name and description) as dev, staging, and prod instances of a single service. **You may not use development or staging applications for production purposes.** **You must keep all API keys or other access credentials private.** You may not use, and may not encourage or facilitate others to use, API keys or other access credentials owned by others. **Your license agreement with X limits your use of the X API and X Content. Among other things, the X API has rate limits which help to ensure fair data usage and to combat spam on the platform.** You may not exceed or circumvent rate limits, or any other limitations or restrictions described in this Policy or your agreement with X, listed on the , or communicated to you by X. **You may not remove or alter any proprietary notices or marks on X Content received via the X API.** This helps to make sure that people know where X Content is coming from, and who it belongs to. **For data integrity and platform health reasons, you may not interfere with, intercept, disrupt, or disable any features of the X API or the X service.** In other words, use the APIs as intended and documented on . Refer to our for more details about acceptable use.

Privacy and control are essential
-----------------------------------

X takes privacy seriously, and we expect everyone using X Content and the X API to do the same. Any use of the X developer platform, X API, or X Content in a manner that is inconsistent with peoples’ reasonable expectations of privacy may be subject to enforcement action, which can include suspension and termination of API and X Content access. Your commitment to privacy and control must extend to all uses of X Content and all aspects of the service that you build using our API. To that end, the people using your service must understand and consent to how you use their data, and how you access X on their behalf. This can be accomplished through providing people with a clear, comprehensive, and transparent privacy policy, as well as ensuring that you get express and informed consent from each person using your service before taking any action on their behalf. **Please note that a person authenticating into your service does not by itself constitute consent.**

Consent & permissions
-----------------------

**In particular, you must get express and informed consent from people before doing any of the following:**

*   Taking _any_ actions on their behalf. This includes (but is not limited to):
    *   Posting content to X
    *   Following/unfollowing accounts
    *   Modifying profile or account information
    *   Adding hashtags or any other content to Posts
*   Republishing content accessed by means other than via the X API or other X tools
*   Using someone’s X Content to promote a product or service
*   Storing non-public content such as Direct Messages (DMs), or any other private or confidential information
*   Sharing or publishing protected content, or any other private or confidential information

**If your service allows people to post content to X you must do the following before publishing:**

*   Show exactly what will be published
*   Make it clear to people using your service what geo information (if any) will be added to the content

**If your service allows people to post content to both your service and X, you must do the following before publishing:**

*   Obtain permission to post the content
*   Explain where you will post the content

**You must respect the protected and blocked status of all X Content. You may not serve content obtained using one person’s authentication token to a different person who is not authorized to view that content.**

*   **Protected accounts:** A ’s content is only available to people who have been approved by the owner to follow that account. So, if you run a service that accesses protected accounts, you may only do so to serve such content to the specific people with permission to view that content.
*   **Blocked accounts:** People on X are able to access to their accounts for any reason they choose. Commingling information obtained from tokens (or any other API-based action) to bypass this choice is not permitted.

**As Direct Messages (DMs) are non-public in nature, services that provide DM features must take extra steps to safeguard personal privacy. You may not serve DM content to people who are not authorized to view that content. If your service provides DM functionality you must also:**

*   Notify people if you send read receipt events for DMs. You can do this by providing a notice directly in your service, or by displaying read receipts from other participants in a conversation.
*   Get consent before configuring media to be sent in a DM as “shared” (i.e. reusable across multiple DMs). If you do allow media in a DM to be “shared,” you must provide a clear notice that this content will be accessible to anyone with the media’s URL.

Content compliance
--------------------

**If you store X Content offline, you must keep it up to date with the current state of that content on X.** Specifically, you must delete or modify any content you have if it is deleted or modified on X. This must be done as soon as reasonably possible, or within 24 hours after receiving a request to do so by X or the applicable X account owner, or as otherwise required by your agreement with X or applicable law. This must be done unless otherwise prohibited by law, and only then with the express written permission of X. Modified content can take various forms. This includes (but is not limited to):

*   Content that has been made private or gained protected status
*   Content that has been suspended from the platform
*   Content that has had geotags removed from it
*   Content that has been withheld or removed from X

Off-X matching
----------------

**We limit the circumstances under which you may match a person on X to information obtained or stored off-X.** Off-X matching involves associating X Content, including a X @handle or user ID, with a person, household, device, browser, or other off-X identifier. You may only do this if you have express opt-in consent from the person before making the association, or as described below. In situations in which you don’t have a person’s express, opt-in consent to link their Xidentity to an off-X identifier, we require that any connection you draw be based only on information that someone would reasonably expect to be used for that purpose. In addition, absent a person’s express opt-in consent you may only attempt to match your records about someone to a X identity based on:

*   **Information provided directly to you by the person.** Note that records about individuals with whom you have no prior relationship, including data about individuals obtained from third parties, do not meet this standard; and/or
*   **Public data.** “Public data” in this context refers to:
    *   Information about a person that you obtained from a public, generally-available resource (such as a directory of members of a professional association)
    *   Information on X about a person that is publicly available, including:
        *   Posts
        *   Profile information, including an account bio and publicly-stated location
        *   Display name and @handle

Your privacy policy
---------------------

**You must display your service’s privacy policy to people before they are permitted to download, install, or sign up to your service.** It must disclose at least the following information:

*   The information that you collect from people who use your service
*   How you use and share that information (including with X)
*   How people can contact you with inquiries and requests regarding their information

Your privacy policy must be consistent with all applicable laws, and be no less protective of people than and the . You must cease your access to the X API and the use of all X Content if you are unable to comply with your and/or X’s Privacy Policy.

Using geo-data
----------------

**Use of geo data comes with additional restrictions due to the sensitive nature of this information.** If your service adds location information to Posts, you must disclose to people:

*   When you add location information
*   Whether you add location information as a geotag or annotations data
*   Whether your location information is listed as a place, or as geographic coordinates

If your application allows people to post with their location you must comply with X’s in full. **Any use of location data or geographic information on a standalone basis is prohibited.** You may not (and may not permit others to) store, aggregate, or cache location data and other geographic information contained in X Content, except as part of a Post. For example, you may not separate location data or geographic information out from Posts to show where individuals have been over time. Heat maps and related tools that show aggregated geo activity (e.g., the number of people in a city using a hashtag) are permitted.

X passwords
-------------

**You may not store X passwords, or request that people provide their X password, account credentials, or developer application information (including consumer key) to you directly.** We suggest the use of as the authentication tool to link your service and people on X.

Platform usage guidelines
---------------------------

Have you taken care to review X’s policies and set up your API access the right way? Does your service follow X’s privacy and control guidelines? If you can answer yes to these two questions, then you are ready to start using the X API and X Content. X’s Platform Usage Guidelines provide the assistance needed to ensure that your use of X Content is compliant from day 1 throughout the lifecycle of your service. We suggest reviewing these rules on a regular basis to make sure that your integration is operating in a way that is safe and beneficial to people on X and the X platform as a whole.

Spam, bots, and automation
----------------------------

**The use of the X API and developer products to create spam, or engage in any form of platform manipulation, is prohibited.** You should review the X Rules on , and ensure that your service does not, and does not enable people to, violate our policies. **Services that perform write actions, including posting Posts, following accounts, or sending Direct Messages, must follow the .** In particular, you should:

*   Always get explicit consent before sending people
*   Immediately respect requests to opt-out of being contacted by you
*   Never perform bulk, aggressive, or spammy actions, including
*   Never post identical or substantially similar content across

**If you’re operating an API-based bot account you must clearly indicate what the account is and who is responsible for it.** You should never mislead or confuse people about whether your account is or is not a bot. A good way to do this is by including a statement that the account is a bot in the profile bio.

X performance benchmarking
----------------------------

**You may not use the X API to measure the availability, performance, functionality, or usage of X for benchmarking, competitive, or commercial purposes.** For example, you should never use the X API to:

*   Calculate aggregate X metrics, such as the total number of Monthly Actives (MAs) or Daily Actives (DAs)
*   Calculate aggregate X Post metrics, such as the total number of Posts posted per day, or the number of account engagements
*   Measure or analyze the responsiveness of X
*   Measure or analyze spam or security on X, except as permitted below

**We support research that helps improve conversational health on X.** You may not publicly disclose any research or findings concerning, or develop, create, or offer services using, the X API or X Content that measure, analyze, or attempt to identify behaviors or content which violate X policies without express written permission from X. **DSA Researchers:** If you need to contact X relating to access under Art. 40 of the Digital Services Act, please contact . If you wish to apply for researcher access, please submit an .

Public display of Posts
-------------------------

**You must maintain the integrity of all X Content that you display publicly or to people who use your service.** If you don’t use to display content, then you must use the X API to retrieve the most current version available for display. If displayed content ceases to be available through the X API, then you must remove it from your service as soon as reasonably possible, or within 24 hours after the receipt of a removal request from X, or the applicable X account owner, or as otherwise required by applicable law. **There are specific rules you must follow if you display X Content offline.** Follow the for using Posts in broadcast if you display Posts offline. **If you embed or display Posts, you must contact us about your X API access if your site exceeds 10 million daily impressions.** X reserves the right to require additional terms as a condition to your use of the X API. Additional restrictions on X for Websites developer use include:

*   **Embedded Posts and/or embedded timelines**
    *   You must provide people with legally sufficient notice that fully discloses X’s collection and use of data about browsing activities on your website, including for interest-based advertising and personalization. You must also obtain legally sufficient consent from people for such collection and use
    *   You must provide legally sufficient instructions on how people can opt out of X’s interest-based advertising and personalization as described
*   **X for Websites widgets**
    *   You must ensure that people are provided with clear and comprehensive information about, and consent to, the storing and accessing of cookies or other information on their devices as described in X’s , where providing such information and obtaining such consent is required by law
*   **Services targeted to children under 13**
    *   Services targeted to children under 13 must opt out of tailoring X in any embedded Post and/or embedded timelines by setting the opt-out parameter to be ‘true’ as described

Content redistribution
------------------------

**The best place to get X Content is directly from X. Consequently, we restrict the redistribution of X Content to third parties.** If you provide X Content to third parties, including downloadable datasets or via an API, you may only distribute Post IDs, Direct Message IDs, and/or User IDs (except as described below). In total, you may not distribute more than 1,500,000 Post IDs to any entity (inclusive of multiple individuals associated with a single entity) within any 30 day period unless you have received written permission from X. In addition, developers may provide up to 500 public Posts Objects and/or User Objects to each person who uses your service on a daily basis if this is done via non-automated means (e.g., download of spreadsheets or PDFs). Academic researchers are permitted to distribute Post IDs and/or User IDs solely for the purposes of non-commercial research on behalf of an academic institution, and that has been approved by X in writing, or peer review or validation of such research. Only as many Post IDs or User IDs that is necessary for such research, and has been approved by X may be used. Any X Content provided to third parties remains subject to this Policy, and those third parties must agree to the X , , , and before receiving such downloads. You may not enable any entity to circumvent any other limitations or restrictions on the distribution of X Content as contained in this , the , or any other agreement with X. **Note:** This Section does not apply to researchers with X API access via Art. 40 of the EU Digital Services Act (2022) (“**DSA**”), who are instead subject to the procedures and restrictions set forth in the DSA and the Developer Agreement.

Pay to engage
---------------

**Your service shouldn’t compensate people to take actions on X, as that results in inauthentic engagement that degrades the health of the platform.** As you use the X API you may not sell or receive monetary or virtual compensation for any X actions. This includes, but is not limited to, Posts, follows, unfollows, reposts, likes, comments, and replies.

Service authenticity
----------------------

**You must clearly identify your service so that people can understand its source and purpose.** Don’t use names, logos, or URLs that mask your service’s identity and features, or that falsely imply an affiliation with X or third parties. Note that creating applications for the purpose of selling names, or to prevent others from using names, is prohibited. **You may not use any URL (including shortened URLs) for your service that directs people to:**

*   A site that is unrelated to your service
*   A spam or malware site
*   A site that encourages people to violate X policy

X name, logo, and likeness
----------------------------

**You may only use and display the X name and logo to identify X as the source of X Content.** You should never use the X name and logo, the X Official Partner Program badge, or any other similar marks or names in a manner that creates a false sense of endorsement, sponsorship, or association with X. The X contain detailed information to help you use the X brand in the right way. **You may only use the X Verified Account badge and any other enhanced account categorization as it is reported to you by X through the API.** This helps people know that the content your service displays is equivalent to that shown on X.

Advertising on X
------------------

**There are restrictions regarding how and where you are allowed to advertise around X Content.** To start, your advertisements can’t resemble or reasonably be confused by people as a Post. Other rules on advertising include:

*   **There must be a clear separation between X Content and your advertisements.** You may not place any advertisements within the X timeline other than X Ads.
*   **X reserves the right to serve advertising via the X API.** If you decide to serve X Ads once we start delivering them via the API, we will share a portion of advertising revenue with you in accordance with the relevant terms and conditions.
*   **You may not use X Content, or information obtained from the X API to target people with advertising outside of the X platform.**

The following additional rules apply for any use of the X services or features listed below:

X Login
---------

**You must present people with easy to find options to log into and out of X, for example via the OAuth protocol.** The _Sign in with X_ option must be displayed at least as prominently as any other sign-up or sign-in feature on your service. You must also provide people without a X account the opportunity to create one via X. **Once someone on your service authenticates via _Sign in with X_ you must clearly display their X identity.** X identity includes the person’s current X @handle, avatar, and X logo. Any display of someone’s X followers on your service must clearly show that the relationship is associated with X.

X Cards
---------

**To ensure a quality experience you must develop your Card to render across all platforms where Cards are displayed.** Additional rules that you must follow when using Cards include:

*   You must mark your Post as ‘true’ for sensitive media if you plan to display such media within a Card
*   You must use HTTPS for hosting all assets within your Card. Your Card should never generate active mixed content browser warnings
*   Audio and video content should include stop or pause controls, and default to ‘sound off’ for videos that automatically play content

**You may not exceed or circumvent X’s limitations placed on any Cards, including the Card’s intended use.** Additional restrictions on Cards use include:

*   You may not place third-party sponsored content within Cards without X’s approval

### 

5\. Clients and Account Management.

**5.1** A Client must be given the ability to quickly and easily disassociate its X Ads Campaigns from the Company Service and regain exclusive, direct control of its X Ads account(s). **5.2** Only a Client and its End Users may be allowed to view such Client’s account data or features via the Company Service.

Exhibit A-2: Analytics Data Display Requirements
--------------------------------------------------

These Analytics Data Display Requirements govern how Company can display Data within the Company Service. Company agrees to abide by these Analytics Data Display Requirements at all times.

### 

Defined Metrics

All campaigns shown in the Company Service that display Data must include the specific X-defined metrics associated with various campaign objectives (each, a “**Campaign Objective**”), which metrics must be calculated by Company based on the endpoints and formulas located at: (or any other successor URL that X may elect from time to time).

### 

Display Guidelines

**1.** The applicable defined metrics for a given Campaign Objective (as described above in the Defined Metrics section of this Exhibit A-2) must be shown every time a campaign is displayed within the Company Service. **2.** If the Company Service displays any organic post analytics data, Company must comply with the X Developer Agreement & Policy located at: as it relates to Company’s implementation, use and display of the organic post analytics data. **3.** If the Company Service displays metrics about campaigns run on third party networks or by third party publishers (i.e., “cross-channel metrics”) side-by-side with Data, then the following requirements and restrictions apply: **3.1** Any cross-channel metrics displayed alongside the Data in the Company Service can only include the same category of campaign objective metrics as the applicable X-defined Campaign Objective metrics for such campaign (as described above in the Defined Metrics section of this Exhibit A-2). By way of example only - If an advertiser is running an app install campaign on a third-party network, only cross-channel metrics that are of the same category as the applicable X-defined metrics for the app install Campaign Objective can be shown alongside the Data. **3.2** Aggregating data to display cross-channel metrics is not permitted unless the aggregated metrics can be referenced (across all third-party networks/publishers) against a category of metrics associated with a campaign objective that is the same to the applicable X-defined Campaign Objective metrics (as described above in the Defined Metrics section of this Exhibit A-2). By way of example only - Aggregating total engagements for network A, network B, and network C would not be permitted if engagement rates across all channels are not calculated using the same formulas. **4.** If the Company Service displays any category of metrics sourced from third parties other than X (“**third-party-sourced metrics**”), then the following requirements and restrictions apply: **4.1** The same requirements and restrictions that apply to displaying cross-channel metrics set forth above in Section 3 apply to the display of any third-party-sourced metrics. **4.2.** Any third-party-sourced metrics that are displayed alongside Data for a campaign in the Company Service must be the same category of campaign objective metrics as the applicable X-defined Campaign Objective metrics for such campaign (as described above in the Defined Metrics section of this Exhibit A-2). By way of example only:

*   If Company displays link click and click-rate metrics from a third-party source, Company will display X’s click and click-rate metrics alongside the third-party-sourced link click and click rate metrics.
*   If Company or any of its Clients uses a third-party tracking solution to track website clicks from Promoted posts and such data is displayed in the Company Service, Company must show link clicks, click rate, cost per link click and CPA from X (if available) alongside such third-party-sourced data.

**4.3** Notwithstanding Section 4.2 of this Exhibit A-2, if the third-party-sourced metrics are from a third-party tracking solution provided by a X Conversion Tracking Partner (as defined below), then X requires that only the Data delivered through the X Ads API (and not any corresponding data delivered by the X Conversion Tracking Partner) is displayed in the Company Service, unless otherwise agreed by X in writing in advance (in each instance). For the avoidance of doubt, Company will not display any data sourced from a X Conversion Tracking Partner alongside, or in place of, any Data delivered through the X Ads API. As used in this Exhibit A-2, “**X Conversion Tracking Partner**” means an authorized X conversion tracking partner (as designated by X, in its sole and absolute discretion).

Exhibit B: Individual Product Terms/Custom Audiences
------------------------------------------------------

Capitalized terms not defined in these Individual Product Terms have the meaning set forth in the main body of the Agreement. To the extent that Company uses or accesses the X Custom Audiences Program the following terms and conditions of this Exhibit B will apply:

The Custom Audiences created on behalf of a specific client(s) will be stored in each such Client’s X Ads account for use by Company or Client to target, or retarget, as applicable, advertising on the X Service. **1.2 Data Usage and Opt-Out.** With respect to any data used in connection with the Custom Audiences Program, in addition to the obligations set out in the Data Protection Addendum found at , Company agrees and, if applicable, will ensure that its Data Partner(s) agree that (i) Company or such Data Partner (as applicable) have secured all necessary rights, consents, waivers, licenses for use of such data, and (ii) that Company or such Data Partner (as applicable) have provided any users from whom the data is collected with legally-sufficient notice that fully discloses the collection, use, and sharing of the data Company provides to X for purposes of serving ads targeting to users’ interests, and legally sufficient instructions on how users can opt out of X’s interest-based advertising through the methods described here (). Data Company uses in connection with the Custom Audiences Program and/or to create a Custom Audience will not include any data from any user who has opted out of having his/her data used by Company, its Data Partner, or any third party on Company’s behalf. If Company receives a user opt-out after such user was included in an audience provided to X, Company must promptly, but no less frequently than once every twenty-four (24) hours, remove such user(s) from any Custom Audience in which such user was included. Company will provide the data in a format selected by X and acceptable to Data Partner (if/as applicable). In addition to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Company’s use of X Custom Audiences program will be subject to the terms of the and Custom Audiences Program T&Cs and applicable policies, including X’s Policies for Conversion Tracking and Custom Audiences, at and . **1.3 Additional Program Requirements.** Company’s access to, and use of, the X Custom Audience Program is additionally subject to its compliance with the technical instructions and program policies provided by X to Company (the “**Program Integration Spec**”). Company and X will mutually agree on a process for Company to import or upload Custom Audiences to X.

### 

2\. Shareable Audiences.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 1.1 hereinabove, as a service to Company, at Company’s request and in Company’s sole discretion, X may allow Company to “share” Custom Audiences created for Company amongst grouped X advertiser accounts and/or X @handles and/or otherwise with third parties on the X Service. As used herein, “sharing” an audience means that Company would instruct X to, without limitation, enable grouped X Advertiser Accounts and/or X @handles and/or third parties to access, use, and target advertising Campaigns against the “shared” Custom Audience. Company represents and warrants that it has all necessary rights and authority to share any such audience data in accordance with the instructions given to X by Company. If Company is providing the audience data, and/or managing the Custom Audiences on behalf of a third party (including, without limitation, a Client), Company represents and warrants that Company has the authority as agent for such party to use any such data on the third party’s behalf, to grant X the rights described herein, and to bind such third party to the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section requires X to make the functionality that enables “sharing” Custom Audiences described herein (or any portion thereof) available at any time to Company or any other third party (including, without limitation, any Client).

Ownership, Betas, and Feedback.** **A. Ownership.** Except to the extent expressly stated otherwise in this Agreement, neither party will acquire any right, title, or interest in any Intellectual Property Rights owned or licensed by the other party. The Licensed Material is licensed, not sold, and X (or its licensors or X Application users, as applicable) retains and reserves all rights, including all Intellectual Property Rights, not expressly granted in this Agreement. You shall not do anything inconsistent with X’s ownership, including without limitation, challenging X’s ownership of the X Marks, challenging the validity of the licenses granted in this Agreement, or otherwise copying or exploiting the X Marks except as specifically authorized in this Agreement. If you acquire any rights in the X Marks or any confusingly similar marks, by operation of law or otherwise, you will, at no expense to X, immediately assign those rights to X. **B. Betas.** X may provide you with early access to non-generally available alphas, betas, research studies, pilots, marketing services, or other programs from time to time (each, a “Beta”). Betas will be considered Confidential Information. Your participation in any Beta is at your own risk, may be subject to additional requirements, and may assist X in research, analyzing, and validating existing or prospective programs, products and/or tools. **C. Feedback.** X will be free to use any feedback, comments, or suggestions you provide X related to X, the Licensed Material, Betas, or any other of X’s products or services (“Feedback”) in any way without any compensation or obligation to you or any third party and Feedback will be deemed Confidential Information.

You may use Confidential Information only as necessary in exercising your rights under this Agreement. You shall not disclose Confidential Information to any third party without X’s prior written consent. You shall protect Confidential Information from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that you would use to protect your own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care. **VII. Term; Credit Purchase Terms; Credit Deduction; Suspension, and Termination.** **A. Term.** The term of this Agreement will start on the date (i) you accept the terms herein or (ii) start accessing or using any of the Licensed Material, whichever is earlier, and will continue until you stop accessing and using the Licensed Material unless terminated earlier as described below. **B. Credit Purchase Terms.** Paid Services provided as part of the Licensed Material are made available through the purchase of Credits that are deducted based on your use of features, benefits, or services, including X API usage, as described on the , Developer Site and the Payment Portal. If you purchase a Paid Service, you do so by first purchasing Credits in advance by paying the applicable fee upfront via the Payment Portal. Your credit balance will be updated after purchase and deducted as you use Paid Services. You must purchase additional credits as needed to enable access to Paid Services. Credit purchases are non-recurring unless you enable optional “Auto-Recharge” features detailed in Section VII.D. When you purchase credits via the Payment Portal, you expressly agree to the terms herein and authorize the charge. X may provide notifications for low balances. Prices for credits and deduction rates are subject to change from time to time as set forth in the Pricing Schedule. X will provide reasonable advance notice of any material change to prices, which notice may be provided via the Developer Site or Payment Portal. Price changes will apply to future purchases and deductions. If you do not agree with a price change, you may cease purchasing credits and using Paid Services. Credits do not expire unless otherwise specified, and are not transferable or refundable except as required by law. **C. Credit Deduction:** Access to Paid Services requires sufficient credits in your account. Each API call or request or use of other feature or service specified in the Pricing Schedule will deduct credits from your balance based on the rates specified in the Pricing Schedule. Deduction rates may vary, and the Pricing Schedule is subject to change. X aims to deduct credits at the time of each call or request or use of other feature or service specified in the Pricing Schedule, and to deny Paid Services for which you have an insufficient balance. In that case, you will need to purchase additional credits to enable the Paid Service. You may not maintain a negative credit balance. It is your responsibility to monitor your credit balance to help maintain access to Paid Services. **D. Usage Disputes**: If you believe there has been an error in credit deductions, you must notify X within thirty (30) days of the disputed deduction via . X will investigate and, if an error is confirmed, adjust your credit balance accordingly. Adjustments are at X’s sole discretion and subject to this Agreement. **E. Payment Terms.** X may offer payment options that vary by Paid Service, device, operating system, geographic location, or other factors, which may be updated from time to time. These payment options may include web payments using a third party payment processor (“Payment Processor”). When you access a Paid Service, you agree: (i) to pay the price listed for Credits, along with any additional amounts relating to applicable taxes, surcharges, credit card fees, bank fees, foreign transaction fees, foreign exchange fees, and currency fluctuations; and (ii) to abide by any applicable terms of service, privacy policies, or other legal agreements or restrictions (including additional age restrictions) imposed by the Payment Processor in connection with your use of a given payment method. The fee will be charged at the time of Credit purchase. It is your responsibility to monitor your Credit balance and make sure your banking, credit card, debit card, and/or other payment information is up to date, complete, and accurate at all times. If you make a payment for a Paid Service through a Payment Processor, X may receive information about your transaction such as when it was made, what platform you made the purchase on, and other information. X will not be liable for any errors made or delays by the Payment Processor, your bank, your credit card company, or any payment network. All payments to X are non-refundable except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or as required by law. **F. Optional Auto-Recharge Feature.** You may opt in to an “auto-recharge” feature via the Developer Console, authorizing X to automatically charge your saved payment method a user-selected amount between 10and10 and 10and100 when your credit balance falls below the threshold set in the auto-recharge tool (typically $5, unless otherwise indicated in the auto-recharge tool), with charges including the applicable taxes and fees for that amount as per Section VII.E; you may modify or disable this feature at any time through the Payment Portal, and by enabling it, you consent to X, via its third-party Payment Processor, charging the selected amount each time the threshold is met, though failed charges (e.g., due to an invalid payment method) will prevent credit additions. Enabling auto-recharge does not guarantee uninterrupted access to Paid Services. You remain responsible for monitoring your credit balance, regardless of notifications X may provide for low balances or auto-recharge events, and auto-recharge charges are non-refundable except as required by law. **D. Taxes and fees.** All fees exclude any and all taxes and similar fees now in force, enacted, or imposed in the future on the transaction, delivery of the Licensed Material, or the delivery of the X Content including any sales, use or value added taxes, goods and services tax, consumption tax, customs duties, tariffs, or similar charges. These taxes may include but are not limited to, VAT, GST, sales tax, withholding tax, and any other applicable taxes but exclude taxes solely based on X’s net income. You are responsible for the payment of all such taxes, duties, and charges and any related penalties and interest arising from the payment of such amounts. In addition, a surcharge may be charged to recover costs associated with Digital Services Tax (“DST”) or similar jurisdiction-specific taxes or regulatory fees incurred by X in certain jurisdictions. This surcharge will appear as a separate line item on your invoice, where applicable, and will be calculated as a percentage of applicable charges as determined by X in its sole discretion. X may adjust this surcharge at any time, without prior notice, in response to increased tax or fee rates or related administrative costs. Depending on your location, X may be responsible for collecting and reporting information related to transaction taxes arising from your purchase of Paid Services. You grant X permission to provide your account and personal information to relevant tax authorities to fulfill our tax collection and reporting obligations. **E. Refunds and Cessation of Paid Services.** You may cease using Paid Services at any time by not making further API calls. Unused credits are non-refundable and non-transferable, with no refunds for purchased or used credits, unless required by law. CREDIT PURCHASES ARE PREPAID, NON-REFUNDABLE (UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW). You may request a refund for unused credits only in accordance with applicable law (e.g., withdrawal rights below). All transactions are final unless you have a right to withdraw pursuant to law, such as provided below. **1\. Withdrawal Right & Refunds for Users Living in EU or UK.** You have a legal right to withdraw from your credit purchase without giving any reason within 14 days from the date of purchase (“Withdrawal Period”). To exercise this right, you must inform X of your decision to withdraw before the Withdrawal Period expires by submitting a clear statement of withdrawal to . If you withdraw within the Withdrawal Period and have not used any credits, X will refund the full amount paid for the credit purchase, including any applicable taxes or fees, within fourteen (14) days of receiving your withdrawal notice, using the same payment method used for the purchase, unless you expressly agree otherwise. However, you expressly acknowledge and agree that if you use any credits during the Withdrawal Period (e.g., by making API calls or requests), you waive your right to withdraw, as the Paid Services will have begun with your prior express consent and acknowledgment that your withdrawal right is lost upon such use. If you use only a portion of your purchased credits during the Withdrawal Period and then exercise your withdrawal right, X will refund the amount corresponding to the unused credits, calculated based on the Pricing Schedule available at . **2\. No Withdrawal Right for Users Living in Taiwan.** If you are a consumer residing in Taiwan, you may be entitled to a seven (7) day withdrawal period for credit purchases under the Consumer Protection Act, unless you have used any credits, in which case the right to withdraw is lost. To exercise this right, you must notify X within seven (7) days from the date of purchase at . Refunds for unused credits will be processed in accordance with applicable law. **F. Credits Are Non-Transferable between X Accounts.** Each purchase of Credits applies to a single X account, meaning that your purchase will apply solely to the account you were using when you purchased the Credits and will not apply to other accounts that you may have access to or control over. If you have or control multiple accounts and you want access to Paid Services on each account, you must purchase the needed Credits on each account individually. You may not allow others to use your X account to access any Licensed Material that such person did not order. You may not purchase Credits or use any Licensed Material if you are a person with whom U.S. persons are not permitted to have dealings pursuant to economic sanctions, including, without limitation, sanctions administered by the United States Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control or any other applicable sanctions authority (“Prohibited Person”). This includes, without limitation, persons located in, a citizen of, or ordinarily resident in the following countries and regions: Cuba, Iran, the Crimea Region of Ukraine, North Korea and Syria. You represent and warrant that you are not a Prohibited Person. **G. Restrictions and Obligations.** You may only purchase and use Credits and use the Licensed Material if you are legally allowed to use the Licensed Material in your country and you live in a country supported by X for the applicable Credit purchase, Paid Service or Licensed Material. X may, in its discretion, restrict the ability to access the Licensed Material or purchase Credits in certain countries. X reserves the right to modify the list of supported countries from time to time. X reserves the right to refuse sale of Credits or access to Paid Services or to cancel or discontinue the sale or use of a Paid Service or the use of any Licensed Material in its sole discretion. **H. Suspension.** X may suspend your use of and access to the Licensed Material immediately without notice (a) if X reasonably believes that (i) your use of the Licensed Material would cause damage to, or an inordinate burden upon, the Licensed Material, (ii) you have violated this Agreement, (iii) you create risk or possible legal exposure for X, (iv) X’s provision of the Licensed Material to you is no longer commercially viable; (b) for prolonged inactivity; (c) if X is requested or directed to do so by any competent court of law, regulatory authority, or law enforcement agency; or (d) for failure to pay for the Paid Services. X will not be liable for damages of any sort that result from any such suspension. **I. Termination.** X may terminate this Agreement for any reason at X’s sole discretion. Such early termination by X shall be effective immediately. If you violate the terms of this Agreement, X may terminate this Agreement for cause immediately upon notice to you and you will not receive a refund for any Credits. You may cancel your access to Paid Services or your use of the Licensed Material on the Developer Site. You will not be entitled to a refund of any Credits, and you will not be entitled to use of any unused Credits. Upon termination of this Agreement: (a) all licenses granted in this Agreement immediately expire and you must cease use of any Licensed Material; and (b) you shall permanently delete all Licensed Material in all forms and types of media, and copies thereof, in your possession. Upon the request of X for any reason, you will promptly (and in any event within ten (10) business days of such request) provide evidence (e.g., screenshots of deletion confirmation) of compliance with the provisions of the aforementioned subpart (b) of this Section. The parties to this Agreement will not be liable to each other for any damages resulting solely from termination of this Agreement as permitted under this Agreement. **VIII. Compliance Audit.** X or a mutually agreed upon third party agent subject to obligations of confidentiality will be entitled to inspect and audit any records related to the performance of this Agreement in your control or possession upon reasonable notice to you, and at a reasonable time during normal business hours, for the purpose of verifying compliance with this Agreement and the fees payable to X for the two (2) year period preceding the audit. X may exercise its audit right no more than once every twelve (12) months unless it has reasonable cause for noncompliance, and such audit shall not unreasonably interfere with your business activities. You will provide your full cooperation and assistance with such audit and provide access to all Licensed Material in your possession, applicable agreements, and records. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as part of the audit, X may request, and you agree to provide, a written report, signed by an authorized representative, listing your then-current deployment of the Licensed Material. You will pay X within thirty (30) business days after the completion of the audit the amount of any underpayment revealed by any such audit. In addition, if any such audit reveals an underpayment by you of five percent (5%) or more, then you will also reimburse X for the reasonable costs and expenses of such audit. The requirements of this Section will survive for one (1) year following the termination of this Agreement. **IX. Disclaimer.** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE LICENSED MATERIAL IS PROVIDED TO YOU “AS IS”, “WHERE IS”, WITH ALL FAULTS, AND X DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NONINFRINGEMENT, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.

If X seeks indemnification or defense from you under this Section, X will promptly notify you in writing of the claim(s) brought against X for which it seeks indemnification or defense. X may assume full control of the defense of claims with legal counsel of its choice. You shall not enter into any third-party agreement that would affect the rights of X, constitute an admission of fault by X, or bind X in any manner without the prior written consent of X. If X assumes control of the defense of such claim, X shall not settle any such claim requiring payment from you without your prior written approval. **XI. Limitation of Liability.** IN NO EVENT WILL X BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY USERS FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY LOSS OF OR DAMAGE TO USE, DATA, BUSINESS, GOODWILL OR PROFITS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT.

More about restricted uses of the X APIs
========================================

Use of our developer platform requires that you review and agree to our , as well as our related policies, including the and . Among other things, our agreements and policies provide guidance about several restricted use cases. We’ve provided additional information about some of these restrictions below.

Sensitive information
-----------------------

You should be careful about using X data to derive or infer potentially sensitive characteristics about X users. Never derive or infer, or store derived or inferred, information about a X user’s:

*   Health (including pregnancy)
*   Negative financial status or condition
*   Political affiliation or beliefs
*   Racial or ethnic origin
*   Religious or philosophical affiliation or beliefs
*   Sex life or sexual orientation
*   Trade union membership
*   Alleged or actual commission of a crime

Aggregate analysis of X content that does not store any personal data (for example, user IDs, usernames, and other identifiers) is permitted, provided that the analysis also complies with applicable laws and all parts of the Developer Agreement and Policy.

Off-X matching
----------------

Off-X matching involves associating X content, including a X username or user ID, with a person, household, device, browser, or other off-X identifier. One example would be associating a X username with a business’s customer records (i.e. “John Doe” in your customer record is matched to @johndoe on X). We want people to feel comfortable to create a separate and, if they choose, pseudonymous identity on X. If you intend to associate any information about a X user with an off-X identifier, we require that you get express, opt-in consent from the user before making the association. For example, you could get this consent if the user shares their X handle directly with you as part of a signup process for your service. In situations in which you do not have a user’s express, opt-in consent to link their X identity to an off-X identifier, we require that any connection you draw be based only on information that a user would reasonably expect to be used for that purpose. If a user would be surprised to learn that you are using information they provided to link their X account to an identity off of X, don’t do it. In addition, absent a person’s express opt-in consent you may only attempt to match your records about someone to a X identity based on:

*   **Information provided directly to you by the user.** Records about individuals with whom you have no prior relationship, including data about individuals obtained from third parties, do not meet this standard; and/or
*   **Public data.** “Public data” in this context refers to:
    *   Information about a user which you obtained from a public, generally-available resource (such as a directory of members of a professional association)
    *   Information on X about a user which is publicly available, including:
        *   Posts
        *   Profile information, including a user’s bio and publicly-stated location
        *   Display name and username

Redistribution of X content
-----------------------------

If you need to share X content you obtained via the X APIs with another party, the best way to do so is by sharing Post IDs, Direct Message IDs, and/or User IDs, which the end user of the content can then rehydrate (i.e. request the full Post, User, or Direct Message content) using the X APIs. This helps ensure that end users of X content always always get the most current information directly from us. We permit limited redistribution of hydrated X content via non-automated means. If you choose to share hydrated X content with another party in this way, you may only share up to 50,000 hydrated public Post Objects and/or User Objects per recipient, per day, and should not make this data publicly available (for example, as an attachment to a blog post or in a public Github repository). There are a few other points to keep in mind about redistributing X content:

*   You may only distribute up to a total of 1,500,000 Post IDs to a single entity within a 30 day period unless you’ve received prior express written permission from X.
*   Individuals redistributing Post IDs and/or User IDs on behalf of an academic institution for the sole purpose of non-commercial research are permitted to redistribute an unlimited number of Post IDs and/or User IDs.
*   To request permission to share X content as outlined above, please use the API Policy support form.

To the extent you are permitted to distribute X content to a third party, note that this content remains subject to the Developer Agreement and Policy, and those third parties must agree to the X , , , and before receiving X content.

Multiple applications
-----------------------

You are not permitted to register multiple applications for a single use case, or substantially similar or overlapping use cases. Learn more about these policies . In this context, we define “use case” as a consistent set of analyses, displays, or actions performed via an application. Providing the same service or application to different end users counts as a single use case: however, “white label” versions of a tool or service are not included. If you plan to “white label” versions of your application, you must notify and receive separate approval from us. These rules apply both to applications you register, and to applications registered by the end users of your tool or service; requiring your end users to register applications for the purpose of using your tool or service could result in enforcement actions against you, your applications, your customers, and/or the end users of your tool or service. The only exception to this rule is to create development (“dev”), staging, and production (“prod”) instances of the same service. Ensure that these applications are clearly labeled (for instance, in the application name or description), and that you do not use development or staging applications for production purposes.

Automation, spam, and auto-responses
--------------------------------------

The use of X’s APIs and developer products to create spam, or engage in spammy behavior, is prohibited. You should review the on spam, and ensure that your application does not, and does not enable users to, violate our policies. If your application will be used to perform write actions on the X service, including posting Posts, following accounts, or sending Direct Messages, you should carefully review the to ensure your service complies with our guidelines. In particular, you should:

*   Always get a user’s explicit consent before sending them
*   Immediately respect user requests to opt-out of being contacted by you
*   Never perform bulk, aggressive, or spammy actions, including
*   Never post identical or substantially similar content across

Measuring the X service
-------------------------

Do not use the X APIs to measure the availability, performance, functionality, or usage of X for benchmarking or competitive purposes. For example, you should never use the X APIs to:

*   Calculate aggregate X user metrics, such as the total number of active users or accounts
*   Calculate aggregate X Post metrics, such as the total number of Posts per day, or the number of user engagements or account engagements
*   Measure or analyze spam or security on X, except as permitted in the

Surveillance, privacy, and user protection
--------------------------------------------

At X, protecting and defending the privacy of our users is built into the core DNA of our company — and our developer and data products reflect that commitment. We believe that X data can be a powerful force for good in the world — from saving lives during flooding in Jakarta to helping the USGS track earthquakes to working with the UN to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. However, we prohibit the use of X data and the X APIs by any entity for surveillance purposes, or in any other way that would be inconsistent with our users’ reasonable expectations of privacy. Period. We describe prohibited uses of our data and developer products in the , including prohibitions on investigating or tracking X users or their content, as well as tracking, alerting, or monitoring sensitive events (such as protests, rallies, or community organizing meetings). Other categories of activities prohibited under these terms include (but are not limited to):

*   Investigating or tracking sensitive groups and organizations, such as unions or activist groups
*   Background checks or any form of extreme vetting
*   Credit or insurance risk analyses
*   Individual profiling or psychographic segmentation
*   Facial recognition

These policies apply to all users of our APIs. Any misuse of the X APIs for these purposes will be subject to enforcement action, which can include suspension and termination of access. For additional information for law enforcement authorities seeking information about X accounts, visit . In addition, at this time, X prohibits any use of the X APIs and/or X Content to fine-tune or train a foundation or frontier model with the exception of .

Geo guidelines
==============

Last Update: October 22, 2014.

Introduction
--------------

Posting With Location is the geotagging feature in the X API. This feature helps to provide a more meaningful experience for users by making posts more contextual. For instance, “Fireworks!” is much more relevant when associated with a location: “Fireworks!” from the SoMa Neighborhood in San Francisco, California. We look forward to working with the developer ecosystem to create great experiences around this functionality!

User Privacy And User Control Of Their Location Information
-------------------------------------------------------------

To ensure a good and safe experience, developers should be sensitive to user privacy when dealing with their location as well as provide baseline consistency in the “Posting with Location” experience. Here are some key things to keep in mind that help protect user privacy and ensure users understand the impact of their actions:

General Guidelines
--------------------

*   Users must opt-in to use the Posting With Location feature (turn location “on”).
*   Users must give explicit permission for their exact location to be displayed with their posts. If the location feature on your client is “sticky” — i.e. once location is turned on it always accompanies a post — you may wish to display only place names (place\_ids) and allow users to further opt in to exact latitude and longitude on a per-post basis or as a specific alternative setting.
*   When you access your users’ location data to post a post, that information should not be stored by you apart from the post without the user’s explicit permission.
*   It must be clear to users what level of location information, if any, will be displayed in association with their post. One way you can do this is by showing a map of how this information will be displayed before the post is published. If exact latitude and longitude is part of the information (or the only information) published by the user on the client, it should be clear to the user that their exact coordinates will be published.
*   Users should be able to turn on and off their location each time they compose a post.
*   You must follow the terms of X’s – including the requirement that you may not aggregate, cache, or store location data and other geographic information from the X API, except as part of a post, and may not use such location data or geographic information on a standalone basis.

Specific Examples
-------------------

Example 1: _No addition of explicit latitude and longitude (this is the current X Web Client UI)_

1.  Show a link to “Add your location” when a user composes a post;
2.  In the background, use the X API call and pass the latitude, longitude, accuracy of your fix, and the user’s preferred granularity (which, by default, is “neighborhood”);
3.  Display the name for the default place (X will attempt to order these in a way that makes sense - the ordering is such that a X client can just display the list without a need for modification);
4.  Allow the user to select a different location from the list (e.g. change from “SoMa, San Francisco” to “South Beach, San Francisco”).
5.  Important: Be transparent with the user if you will be displaying exact location information. Make sure the user knows if exact location information will be displayed.
6.  Allow the user the choice to turn on or off location with every post compose.

Example 2: _Existing geotagging implementations_ A number of X client apps have the original geotagging feature (which only broadcast lat/lons without providing place\_IDs) implemented. The default behavior of the API mimics this behavior – i.e. as a developer you do not need to make any changes to your existing app in order to maintain the behavior that exists today. Indeed, if you simply pass a lat/lon coordinate in to X, X will automatically reverse geocode that latitude and longitude and display the place\_ID in addition to lat/lon for areas where we have data available. Ensure that it is transparent to your users that their exact coordinates are being used and displayed on X. A best practice for existing apps would be to allow users to turn on or off their location on a per-post basis. You can also enable your users to share only place\_IDs instead of exact coordinates as a default, “sticky” setting.

X Storage Of User Location Data
---------------------------------

X will store data passed by the client as follows:

*   X will save all the data that a user chooses to publicly display to his/her followers. This is similar to how X stores the time stamp that says when the post was made, meaning if a user posts with their exact coordinates, X will store this exact location along with the post for as long as the post exists. Users can clear location data from their posts by clicking the “clear my location history” button on the Settings page as described ).

Summary
---------

The addition of location to a post adds an enormous amount of context and value from a user perspective. However, implementations of location in your client should be careful to take privacy and user transparency as a key consideration in designing a location-focused product. If you have any questions or comments about privacy, location, and other geo features, please

Display requirements: Posts
===========================

General principles and Post anatomy
-------------------------------------

Posts are one of our most visible brand elements, so it’s important that they are presented correctly. You should comply with the display requirements below when you display posts, timelines, and other X content. If you follow these guidelines merely to display a post, you may not need to contact X for any additional display or trademark permissions. However, you may still want to submit your proposed use and context for X review. (Note that, in some cases, permission from the original content creator may still be necessary, as X does not provide permission to use third party/user content.) The following general principles apply to all display mediums. Please note, medium-specific requirements do apply, and are are outlined in the sections below. The image below shows all the main components of a post.

### 

Do

*   Display real, unmodified posts from real accounts.
*   Follow X’s , the , and (if applicable) the .
*   Display the X logo.

### 

Don’t

*   Use X content to promote any product or service (e.g., by displaying X content in advertising or otherwise displaying X content to imply endorsement of any product or service) without explicit permission from the user.
*   Use X content to imply sponsorship by, endorsement from, or a false association with X.
*   Include buttons or icons from other social platforms.
*   Modify post text.
*   Use mock ups of posts that don’t exist on the platform.

* * *

Online display / Mobile, web, and beyond
------------------------------------------

We’re committed to bringing the ease and power of X to everyone. To ensure every post is displayed optimally, we strongly encourage using . When you use these products to publish X content, posts and timelines are automatically rendered correctly, including advanced features like photos, video playback, edited posts, and fetching of up-to-date X data without OAuth. If it is not possible for you to use our embedding features, you must follow the requirements below when displaying posts and timelines online.

### 

Post author

*   The post author’s profile picture, @username, and display name must always be displayed and link to the user’s X profile.
*   The post author’s @username must always be displayed with the “@” symbol.
*   The post author’s avatar must be positioned to the left of the author’s name and @username—except for posts in languages that read right to left, in which case the author’s avatar must be positioned to the right of the author’s display name and @username.

### 

Post text

*   The post text must be displayed on a line below the author’s display name and @username, and may not be altered or modified.
*   On touch devices, the white space around the post text and post author must link to the post’s permalink.
*   Post entities within the post text must be properly linked to their appropriate home on X. For example:
    *   User @mentions must link to the mentioned user’s profile.
    *   Hashtags must link to a X search with the hashtag as the query.
    *   Links in post text must be displayed using the display\_url field in the URL entities API response, and link to the original t.co url field.

### 

Timestamp

*   The post timestamp must be displayed and link to the post’s permalink.

### 

Post Actions

*   All post Action icons (including reply, repost, and like) must always be visible for the user to interact with the post. These actions must be implemented using or with the authenticated X API. In lieu of post Actions, “View on X” may be shown next to the timestamp, linking the user to the post permalink.
*   No other social or third party actions may be attached to a post. (e.g., subscribe, comment, like).
*   If the post being displayed is a repost, the display name of the user who reposted it and the repost icon must be displayed above or under the post text. e.g., “reposted by Jane Doe”. The display name must link to the profile of the user who reposted it.
*   Follow .

### 

Post edits

*   X allows people to edit their posts up to 5 times during the first 30 minutes after posting the original post. When using , the display will appear slightly different depending on whether the post was edited before or after it was embedded.
*   When a post is embedded first, and then edited, you must display those edits as they occur on the X platform:
*   If you are displaying a previous version of an edited post, you must note below the timestamp that there is a new version of the post, and to the right of that note, provide a link which expands the post’s edit history.
*   You must then display the full edit history of the post.

When a post has been edited first, and then embedded, you must note in the timestamp that the post was edited, and the timestamp must also link to the live post on X.

### 

Branding

*   The official X logo must always be reasonably visible and displayed on the upper-right corner of an individual post or directly attached to the timeline (e.g., top of the timeline). The logo should be the same height “x” as in the image. See X’s for brand guidelines and assets.

### 

Mobile deep linking

*   Deep links from native mobile apps must direct to the native X application. If the native X application is not installed on the device, the link must direct to X.com via a web browser.

### 

Timelines

*   All timelines must allow users to view the details of an individual post (e.g., by linking the post timestamp or by linking the entire post area).

If you plan any advertising near posts, please ensure it complies with the . If for any reason you cannot comply with one or more of these rules, please contact us directly via our before displaying X content. For questions or further information about use of the X name and trademarks, please contact .
