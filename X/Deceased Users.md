How to contact X about a deceased family member's account
=========================================================

### Deceased User 

In the event of the death of a X user, we can work with a person authorized to act on behalf of the estate, or with a verified immediate family member of the deceased to have an account deactivated.

[Request the removal of a deceased user's account.](https://help.x.com/forms/account-access/deactivate-or-close-account/deactivate-account-for-deceased) After you submit your request, we will email you with instructions for providing more details, including information about the deceased, a copy of your ID, and a copy of the deceased’s death certificate. This is a necessary step to prevent false and/or unauthorized reports. Be assured that this information will remain confidential and will be removed once we've reviewed it.
