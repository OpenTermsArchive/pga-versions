The X Rules
===========

X's purpose is to serve the public conversation. Violence, harassment and other similar types of behavior discourage people from expressing themselves, and ultimately diminish the value of global public conversation. Our rules are to ensure all people can participate in the public conversation freely and safely.

Violent Content 

**May 2024**

**You may share graphic media if it is properly labeled, not prominently displayed and is not excessively gory or depicting sexual violence, but explicitly threatening, inciting, glorifying, or expressing desire for violence is not allowed.** 

X is a place where people can express themselves, show and learn about what’s happening, and debate global issues, often sharing images and videos as part of the conversation. However, healthy conversations can’t thrive when Violent Speech is used to deliver a message, and not every participant wishes to be exposed to Violent Media. As a result, we may remove or reduce the visibility of Violent Content to ensure the safety of our users and prevent the normalization or glorification of violent actions. We also do not allow sharing Violent Content in highly visible places such as profile photos, banners or bio.  

How we define Violent Content

Violent Content is any content containing Violent Speech or Violent Media, as defined below: 

**Violent Speech:** Content that threatens, incites, glorifies, or expresses desire for violence or harm.

### Learn more about our enforcement

Not Allowed  

We prohibit Violent Speech that we consider high in severity and likelihood of harm. Such content must be removed and subsequent violations may result in the account being placed in read-only mode or suspended. Examples include explicit statements that are:

* Violent Threats: Threats to inflict physical harm on others, which includes threatening to kill, torture, sexually assault, or otherwise hurt someone. This also includes threatening to damage civilian homes and shelters, or infrastructure that is essential to daily, civic, religious, or business activities;
* Wish of Harm: Wishing, hoping or expressing desire for harm. This includes hoping for others to die, suffer illnesses, tragic incidents, or experience other physically harmful consequences;
* Incitement of Violence: Inciting, promoting or encouraging others to commit acts of violence or harm, including encouraging others to hurt themselves or inciting others to commit atrocity crimes such as crimes against humanity, war crimes or genocide;
* Glorification of Violence: Glorifying, praising, or celebrating acts of violence where harm occurred, including expressing gratitude or praising that someone experienced physical harm by [Violent Entities](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/violent-entities). This also includes glorifying animal abuse or cruelty. 

We also prohibit Violent Speech within areas that are highly visible on X, such as in live video, profile, header, bio, list banner images, or community cover photos.

Restricted Reach 

We ensure we take proportionate action based on the severity and likelihood of harm. Therefore, in certain cases, we may make the violative content less visible by [restricting its reach](https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies/enforcement-options) on X. This includes when we assessed:

* harm is minor or non-deliberate;
    
* context is self-defense or military conflict; 
    
* context is outrage or reactive against perpetrators of major harm; 
    
* the target is unclear; 
    
* usage of coded language (often referred to as "dog whistles") to indirectly incite violence.
    

Allowed

We seek to evaluate and understand contextual nuances behind the conversation before taking action, and we allow expressions of Violent Speech when there is no clear abusive or violent context, such as:

* hyperbolic and consensual speech between friends, or during discussion of video games and sporting events; 
    
* figures of speech, satire, or artistic expression when the context is expressing a viewpoint rather than instigating actionable violence or harm;
    
* quotes from books and movies, music lyrics or poetry when the context is expressing a viewpoint rather than instigating actionable violence or harm.
    

**Violent Media**: Visual material depicting graphic, violent or excessively gory content including sexual violence. 

### Learn more about our enforcement

Not Allowed  

We prohibit Violent Media that we consider high in severity and likelihood of harm. Such content must be removed and subsequent violations may result in the account being placed in read-only mode or suspended. This includes:

* Violent Sexual Conduct: Media that depicts violence, whether real or simulated, in association with sexual acts, including rape and other forms of violent sexual assault such as sexual acts that occur without the consent of participants, and sexualized violence within an intimate setting, where it is not immediately obvious if those involved have consented to take part;
* Gratuitous Gore: Media of humans or animals that depicts excessively graphic or gruesome content related to death, violence or severe physical harm including dismembered or mutilated humans, charred or burned human remains, exposed internal organs or bones and animal torture or killing; 
    
* Moment of Death: Images or videos where a reasonably identifiable person is clearly deceased or depicts the murder of an identifiable individual if we receive a request from their family or an authorized representative; 
    
* Bestiality & Necrophilia: Media that depicts sexual acts between a human and an animal or sexual acts between a living human and a human corpse.

We also prohibit Violent Media within areas that are highly visible on X, such as in live video, profile, header, list banner images, or community cover photos or targeting someone nonconsensually with unwanted Violent Media. 

Restricted Reach

You’re allowed to post the following Violent Media provided it’s properly labeled with a content warning so users who do not wish to see it can avoid it. This also helps ensure children below the age of 18 are not exposed to it. Examples include depictions of Graphic Media, such as:

* violent crimes or accidents;
    
* physical fights;
    
* bodily fluids including blood, feces etc.;
    
* serious physical harm, including visible wounds;
    
* severely injured or mutilated animals;
    

* media of humans or animals that depicts death, violence, medical procedures, or serious physical injury in graphic detail but does not rise to the threshold of excessively gory;
* excessively gory media that is otherwise removed may remain on the platform if it is associated with newsworthy events, to raise awareness or to call for political action, and is properly labeled with a content warning.

Allowed 

We seek to evaluate and understand contextual nuances surrounding the content before taking action, therefore, we allow some types of media without removal or restriction, such as when there is: 

* violence depicting animals as a result of hunting or fishing, food manufacturing or processing, bullfighting, or religious sacrifice unless it contains excessively gory content;
* painted or illustrated art portraying violence; 
* humor or satire, including memes;
* physical recovery or medical content such as scars or healed wounds, stitches, or prosthetics;
* simulated blood used for events, protests, entertainment or art;
* historical content including media from history books, or museum stills;

* explosions, altercations, destruction of property, surveillance media or shootings with no prohibited Violent Media present.

How to mark your content 

If you regularly post Graphic Media on X, we ask that you [adjust](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/media-settings) your media settings. Doing so places all your images and videos behind a content warning that needs to be acknowledged before your media can be viewed. You can also add a one-time content warning on individual posts. If you continue to fail marking your posts, we will adjust your account settings for you. 

Users under 18 or viewers who do not include a birth date on their profile cannot click to view marked content. Learn more about age restricted content [here](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/notices-on-twitter.html). 

You may begin to see new media content warnings on posts that X has designated as containing Graphic Content (instead of a generic sensitive media label). When these new content warnings are available for you to use, please be sure to continue marking your media accordingly.

How to report 

Anyone can report unmarked content or other violations using our dedicated in-app reporting flow.

Child safety

### **May 2024**  

**We have zero tolerance for any forms of child sexual exploitation and remove certain media depicting physical child abuse to prevent the normalization of violence against children.**

Our Child Safety policy is designed to protect minors from sexual and physical abuse, as well as psychological harm that may result from sharing such content. With this principle in mind, Child Safety content is any content that contains Child Sexual Exploitation, Physical Child Abuse Media and Media of Minors in Physical Altercation, as defined below. 

We encourage our users to come to X to share stories, raise awareness, and speak their mind - including calling attention to the exploitation of children and minors. However, even when shared with the intent to bring awareness or justice, to express outrage or sharing content in a humoristic context, posting media of children experiencing sexual abuse or certain types of physical abuse can contribute to their revictimization and may even lead to the normalization of sexual or physical violence against children. When this content is shared on X, we may remove it even if it was shared with good intent. Our priority is to protect minors from physical and psychological harm irrespective of the context in which the content may be shared. 

We use the terms children and minors interchangeably in any of our policies and define them as any person under the age of 18. 

**Child Sexual Exploitation**

X has zero tolerance towards any material that features or promotes child sexual exploitation. This may include real media, text, illustrated, or computer-generated media - including generative AI media. Regardless of the intent, anyone viewing, sharing, linking, or engaging with any kind of child sexual exploitation material contributes to the re-victimization of the depicted children and puts children at an extreme risk of being harmed. This also applies to content that may further contribute to victimization of children through the promotion or glorification of child sexual exploitation.

### Learn more

**Not allowed** 

Any content that depicts or promotes child sexual exploitation is strictly prohibited on X. This includes, but is not limited to, directly or indirectly sharing, requesting, linking to, engaging with (such as liking or reposting, or following accounts that distribute), expressing a desire for, or describing:

* depictions of a child engaging in sexually explicit or suggestive acts, which may include edits of such media, such as obscuring faces or body parts;
* sexualized commentaries about or directed at a known (or unknown) minor;
    
* links to third-party sites that host child sexual exploitation materials of any kind; and
    
* fantasies about or promoting engagement in child sexual exploitation.
    

Additionally, we prohibit any of the following:

* identifying alleged victims of childhood sexual exploitation by name or image;
    
* promoting or normalizing sexual attraction to minors as a form of identity or sexual orientation;
    
* sending sexually explicit media to a child, or engaging or trying to engage a child in a sexually explicit conversation;
    
* trying to obtain sexually explicit media from a child, or trying to engage a child in sexual activity through blackmail or other incentives;
    
* recruiting, advertising or expressing an interest in a commercial sex act involving a child, or in harboring and/or transporting a child for sexual purposes; and
    
* threatening to share, or requesting that others share sexual media of minors, including self-generated sexual media of minors, particularly when engaging in blackmail or bounty tactics.
    

**Allowed** 

We will make very limited exceptions to content related to child sexual exploitation only where there is a low risk of direct harm to the minor(s):  

* discussion related to child sexual exploitation that does not promote or glorify child sexual exploitation in any way or identify the potential victim;
    
* victims sharing their stories, provided they do not contain explicit details or media;
    
* conversations about help-seeking behavior of individuals who may struggle with an attraction to minors; and
    
* advocacy against illegal or harmful activity involving minors, provided there is no sharing of, or linking to any material featuring child sexual exploitation.
    

**For violations of our Child Sexual Exploitation policy:**

* in the majority of cases, users will be immediately and permanently suspended; 
* additionally, when we’re made aware of content depicting or promoting child sexual exploitation, including links to third party sites where this content can be accessed, the accounts sharing this content will be reported to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC); and
    
* for certain violations, we may instead require post removal. For example, we may ask someone to remove the violating content. Subsequent violations may lead to account suspension.
    

**Physical Child Abuse Media**

To prevent the revictimization or normalization of violence against children, we will remove most instances of media depicting physical child abuse, even if shared to raise awareness or express outrage.

When assessing the best course of action to take, we consider:

* whether the child is nude, partially clothed, or fully clothed;
    
* the severity of harm the child is experiencing; and 
    
* whether the media was shared with abusive, non-abusive, or newsworthy context.
    

### Learn more

**Not allowed** 

With the above criteria in mind, we are more likely to remove any media: 

* where the child is nude and experiencing any type of harm;
    
* shared with abusive context; and
    
* where the child is experiencing moderate or major harm.
    

**Restricted reach**

We will make limited exceptions to media depicting physical child abuse in certain circumstances, such as:  

* when the media is being shared to identify the child in order to rescue them from the abusive situation, or identify the perpetrator; and
    
* when the media is being shared by news organizations.
    

If we decide to allow this media on the platform, we will require it to be placed behind our Graphic Content warning.  

**For violations of our Physical Child Abuse Media policy, we may:**

Make the content less visible on X by:

* applying a content warning; or
* requiring post removal. For example, we may ask someone to remove the violating content and serve a period of time in read-only mode before they can post again. Subsequent violations may lead to account suspension.

Suspend accounts whose sole purpose appears to be to engage in the types of behavior prohibited above.

**Media of Minors in Physical Altercation**

We aim to protect the wellbeing of minors involved in physical altercation, regardless of their status (i.e victim or aggressor), while balancing the need to raise awareness of these issues. When assessing the best course of action to take, we may consider whether:

* the content is shared with an abusive or non-abusive context;
    
* we have received a report from the minor or an authorized representative; and
    
* the content is excessively graphic.
    

### Learn more

**Restricted reach**

We will make limited exceptions to media depicting children in physical altercation in certain circumstances, such as when the media is being shared by news organizations. If we decide to allow this media on the platform, we may require it to be placed behind a content warning.  

**For violations of our Media of Minors is Physical Altercation policy:**

* We may require post removal upon receiving a report from the minor or an authorized representative.  For example, we may ask someone to remove the violating content and serve a period of time in read-only mode before they can post again. Subsequent violations may lead to account suspension; 
    
* when sharing content that is abusive towards the victim [Abusive Behavior](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/abusive-behavior) policies may apply; and
    
* when sharing content that is Graphic or includes Gratuitous Gore, our [Sensitive Media](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/media-policy) policies may apply.

**How to Report**

Anyone can report violations of this policy using our dedicated in-app reporting flow or via our [Help Center](https://help.x.com/en/forms/safety-and-sensitive-content/cse). An X account is not needed to report potential violations.

Abuse and Harassment
====================

Overview
--------

### March 2024

**  
You may not target others with abuse or harassment, or encourage other people to do so.**  

X's mission is to give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information, as well as express their opinions and beliefs without barriers. Free expression is a human right – we believe that everyone has a voice, and the right to use it. Our role is to serve the public conversation, which requires representation of a diverse range of perspectives.   

We recognize that if anyone, regardless of background, experiences harassment on X, it can jeopardize their ability to express themselves and cause harm. To facilitate healthy dialogue on the platform, and empower individuals to express diverse opinions and beliefs, we prohibit behavior and content that harasses, shames, or degrades others. In addition to posing risks to people’s safety, these types of behavior may also lead to physical and emotional hardship for those affected.  

  
What is in violation of this policy?
---------------------------------------

We prohibit behavior and content that harasses, shames, or degrades others, as defined below. Please note that, in order to help our teams understand the context, we sometimes need to hear directly from the person being targeted to ensure that we have the necessary information prior to taking appropriate and proportionate enforcement action.

###   
Targeted Harassment  

We prohibit the malicious, unreciprocated targeting (such as mentioning or tagging) of individual(s), particularly when shared to humiliate or degrade someone. This can mean:

* Sharing multiple Posts, over a short period of time, or continuously posting replies with malicious content, to target an individual. This includes accounts dedicated to harassing an individual or multiple individuals.
    
* Mentioning or tagging users with malicious content.
    

###   
Violent Event Denial  

We prohibit content that denies that mass murder or other mass casualty events took place, where we can verify that the event occurred, and when the content is shared with abusive context. This may include references to such an event as a “hoax” or claims that victims or survivors are fake or “actors.” It includes, but is not limited to, events like the Holocaust, school shootings, terrorist attacks, and natural disasters.

###   
Incitement of Harassment  

We prohibit behavior that encourages others to harass or target specific individuals or groups of people with abuse. This includes, but is not limited to: calls to target people with abuse or harassment online and behavior that urges offline action, such as physical harassment.

###   
Unwanted Sexual Content & Graphic Objectification  

While some [consensual nudity and adult content is permitted](https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies/media-policy) on X, we prohibit unwanted sexual conduct and graphic objectification that sexually objectifies an individual without their consent. This includes, but is not limited to:

* sending someone unsolicited and/or unwanted adult media (images, videos, and GIFs) 
    
* unwanted sexual discussion of someone’s body 
    
* solicitation of sexual acts
    
* any other content that otherwise sexualizes an individual without their consent. 
    

###   
Insults  

We take action against the use of insults or profanity to target others. However, while some individuals may find certain terms to be offensive, we will not take action against every instance where insulting terms are used. 

###   
Use of Prior Names and Pronouns  

Where required by local laws, we will reduce the visibility of posts that purposefully use different pronouns to address someone other than what that person uses for themselves, or that use a previous name that someone no longer goes by as part of their transition. Given the complexity of determining whether such a violation has occurred, we must always hear from the target to determine if a violation has occurred.

  
What is not in violation of this policy?
-------------------------------------------

Some posts may appear to be harmful when viewed in isolation, but may not be when viewed in the context of a larger conversation. For example, friends may consensually use certain terms or phrases to engage with each other that could appear abusive without this context. We also recognise that our platform can be used to call attention to, condemn, or highlight others for harmful behaviors. In such cases, we do not take action where the context is clearly non-abusive and intended to counter these kinds of rhetoric.

We also believe that criticism of institutions, practices and ideas is a fundamental part of the freedom of expression and thus we will not take action on such critical commentary.

  
Who can report violations of this policy?
--------------------------------------------

Anyone can report violations of this policy using our dedicated reporting flow. However, we sometimes need to hear directly from the person being targeted to ensure that we have the information needed prior to taking any enforcement action.

  
What happens if you violate this policy?
-------------------------------------------

When determining the penalty for violating this policy, we consider a number of factors including, but not limited to the severity of the violation, whether someone has been targeted (such as being mentioned, referred to by full name, referenced with a photo, etc), and an individual’s previous record of rule violations. The following is a list of potential enforcement options for content that violates this policy:

* Making content less visible on X by:
    
    * Removing the post from search results, in-product recommendations, trends, notifications, and home timelines 
        
    * Restricting the post discoverability to the author’s profile
        
    * Downranking the post in replies
        
    * Restricting likes, replies, reposts, quote, bookmarks, share, pin to profile, or engagement counts 
        
    * Excluding the post from having ads adjacent to it
        
* Excluding posts and/or accounts in email or in-product recommendations. 
    
* Requiring post removal.
    
    * For example, we may ask someone to remove the violating content and serve a period of time in read-only mode before they can post again. Subsequent violations may lead to account suspension.
        
* Suspending accounts whose sole purpose is to violate our Unwanted Sexual Content & Graphic Objectification policy, or accounts that are dedicated to harassing individuals.

Hateful Conduct
===============

### Overview 

**April 2023**

You may not directly attack other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, caste, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease. 

X's mission is to give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information, and to express their opinions and beliefs without barriers. Free expression is a human right – we believe that everyone has a voice, and the right to use it. Our role is to serve the public conversation, which requires representation of a diverse range of perspectives. 

We recognize that if people experience abuse on X, it can jeopardize their ability to express themselves. Research has shown that some groups of people are disproportionately targeted with abuse online. For those who identify with multiple underrepresented groups, abuse may be more common, more severe in nature, and more harmful.

We are committed to combating abuse motivated by hatred, prejudice or intolerance, particularly abuse that seeks to silence the voices of those who have been historically marginalized. For this reason, we prohibit behavior that targets individuals or groups with abuse based on their perceived membership in a protected category.  

If you see something on X that you believe violates this policy, please [report it to us](https://help.x.com/en/forms/safety-and-sensitive-content/abuse.html).

### What is in violation of this policy?  

We will review and take action against reports of accounts targeting an individual or group of people with any of the following behavior, whether within Posts or Direct Messages. 

**Hateful references  
  
**We prohibit targeting individuals or groups with content that references forms of violence or violent events where a protected category was the primary target or victims, where the intent is to harass. This includes, but is not limited to media or text that refers to or depicts:

* genocides, (e.g., the Holocaust);
* lynchings.

**Incitement  
**

We prohibit inciting behavior that targets individuals or groups of people belonging to protected categories. This includes:

* inciting fear or spreading fearful stereotypes about a protected category, including asserting that members of a protected category are more likely to take part in dangerous or illegal activities, e.g., “all \[religious group\] are terrorists.”
* inciting others to harass members of a protected category on or off platform, e.g., “I’m sick of these \[religious group\] thinking they are better than us, if any of you see someone wearing a \[religious symbol of the religious group\], grab it off them and post pics!“
* inciting others to discriminate in the form of denial of support to the economic enterprise of an individual or group because of their perceived membership in a protected category, e.g., “If you go to a \[religious group\] store, you are supporting those \[slur\], let’s stop giving our money to these \[religious slur\].” This may not include content intended as political in nature, such as political commentary or content relating to boycotts or protests.

Note: content intended to incite violence against a protected category is prohibited under [Violent Speech](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/violent-speech.html).

**Slurs and Tropes**  
  
We prohibit targeting others with repeated slurs, tropes or other content that intends to degrade or reinforce negative or harmful stereotypes about a protected category. In some cases, such as (but not limited to) severe, repetitive usage of slurs, or racist/sexist tropes where the context is to harass or intimidate others, we may require Post removal. In other cases, such as (but not limited to) moderate, isolated usage where the context is to harass or intimidate others, we may limit Post visibility as further described below.

**Dehumanization**

We prohibit the dehumanization of a group of people based on their religion, caste, age, disability, serious disease, national origin, race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, or sexual orientation.

**Hateful Imagery** 

We consider hateful imagery to be logos, symbols, or images whose purpose is to promote hostility and malice against others based on their race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or ethnicity/national origin. Some examples of hateful imagery include, but are not limited to:

* symbols historically associated with hate groups, e.g., the Nazi swastika;
* images depicting others as less than human, or altered to include hateful symbols, e.g., altering images of individuals to include animalistic features; or
* images altered to include hateful symbols or references to a mass murder that targeted a protected category, e.g., manipulating images of individuals to include yellow Star of David badges, in reference to the Holocaust.

Media depicting hateful imagery is not permitted within live video, account bio, profile or header images. All other instances must be marked as sensitive media. Additionally, sending an individual unsolicited hateful imagery is a violation of this policy. 

**Hateful Profile**

You may not use hateful images or symbols in your profile image or profile header. You also may not use your username, display name, or profile bio to engage in abusive behavior, such as targeted harassment or expressing hate towards a person, group, or protected category.

### Do I need to be the target of this content for it to be a violation of the X Rules?  

Some Posts may appear to be hateful when viewed in isolation, but may not be when viewed in the context of a larger conversation. For example, members of a protected category may refer to each other using terms that are typically considered as slurs. When used consensually, the context behind these terms is not abusive, but a means to reclaim terms that were historically used to demean individuals.  

When we review this type of content, it may not be clear whether the context is to abuse an individual on the basis of their protected status, or if it is part of a consensual conversation. To help our teams understand the context, we sometimes need to hear directly from the person being targeted to ensure that we have the information needed prior to taking any enforcement action.

**Note:** individuals do not need to be a member of a specific protected category for us to take action. We will never ask people to prove or disprove membership in any protected category and we will not investigate this information. 

### What happens if you violate this policy?  

Under this policy, we take action against behavior that targets individuals or an entire protected category with hateful conduct, as described above. Targeting can happen in a number of ways, for example, mentions, including a photo of an individual, referring to someone by their full name, etc.

When determining the penalty for violating this policy, we consider a number of factors including, but not limited to the severity of the violation and an individual’s previous record of rule violations. The following is a list of potential enforcement options for content that violates this policy:

* Making content less visible on X by:
    * Removing the Post from search results, in-product recommendations, trends, notifications, and home timelines 
        
    * Restricting the Post discoverability to the author’s profile
        
    * Downranking the Post in replies
        
    * Restricting Likes, replies, Reposts, Quote, bookmarks, share, pin to profile, or engagement counts 
        
    * Excluding the Post from having ads adjacent to it
        
* Excluding Posts and/or accounts in email or in-product recommendations. 
    
* Requiring Post removal.
    * For example, we may ask someone to remove the violating content and serve a period of time in read-only mode before they can Post again.
* Suspending accounts that violate our Hateful Profile policy.

Learn more about our [range of enforcement options](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/enforcement-options.html). 

If someone believes their account was suspended in error, they can [submit an appeal](https://help.x.com/en/forms/account-access/appeals.html).

Perpetrators of Violent Attacks
===============================

Overview

**February 2023**

**We will remove any accounts maintained by individual perpetrators of terrorist, violent extremist, or mass violent attacks, as well as any accounts glorifying the perpetrator(s), or dedicated to sharing manifestos and/or third party links where related content is hosted. We may also remove Posts disseminating manifestos or other content produced by perpetrators.**

We want X to be a place where people can find reliable information and express themselves freely and safely without feeling burdened by unhealthy content. In the aftermath of terrorist, violent extremist and mass violent attacks, we know many want to express compassion for victims, condemn the attacks and/or the perpetrators, and discuss how these incidents impact people and their communities. Some might also wish to share manifestos or other similar content produced by the attack’s apparent perpetrator or an accomplice, either to express outrage or condemnation of the perpetrator’s possible motives. 

The violence that these perpetrators engage in, and the rationale they outline in manifestos or other means that normalizes hatred and discrimination, may further jeopardize the physical safety and well-being of those who are targeted, and has the potential to inspire future attacks. Exposure to these materials may also cause harm to those that view them. 

We believe the hateful and discriminatory views promoted in content produced by perpetrators are harmful for society and their dissemination should be limited in order to prevent perpetrators from publicizing their message. As a result we may remove Posts that include manifestos or other similar material produced by perpetrators, even if the context is not abusive. However, we may allow newsworthy content if it does not:

* Convey suggestions about how to arm oneself and choose targets;
* Share hateful slogans, symbols, memes, and/or hateful conspiracy theories;
* Outline the perpetrator’s ideology, tactical choices, and/or plan of attack.

**What is a manifesto?**

We define a manifesto as a statement by a perpetrator outlining their motivation, views, or intent to engage in a violent attack. A manifesto can be in the form of a written document, social media post, audio recording, video, external link, or letter or other forms of content. It may be shared in the aftermath, or at any period before a violent attack. A manifesto can be linked to the event through a statement of warning or intent.

**Who are the individual perpetrators of terrorist, violent extremist, and mass violent attacks?**

Violent attacks claimed by a violent organization or by a member of such organizations are covered under our [Violent and Hateful Entitites policy](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/violent-entities.html). We do not require that a person have been confirmed as members of terrorist organizations or other violent and hateful entities, nor that they have any official affiliation with any group, organization, or ideology, for us to enforce on content under this aspect of our policies.

Suicide and Self-harm policy
============================

Overview  
 

**You may not promote or encourage suicide or self-harm.**

At X, we recognize that suicide and self-harm are significant social & public health challenges that require collaboration between all stakeholders – public, private, and civil society – and that we have a role and responsibility to help people access and receive support when they need it.  

When developing this policy, we consulted extensively with experts to ensure that people who have engaged in self-harm or experienced suicidal thoughts can share their personal experiences. We also recognized the need to protect people from the potential harm caused by exposure to content that could promote or encourage self-harm – intentionally or inadvertently. That’s why our policy prohibits content that promotes or encourages self-harming behaviors and provides support to those undergoing experiences with self-harm or suicidal thoughts.  
 

### What is in violation of this policy? 

Under this policy, you can’t promote, or otherwise encourage, suicide or self-harm. We define promotion and encouragement to include statements such as “the most effective”, “the easiest”, “the best”, “the most successful”, “you should”, “why don’t you”. Violations of this policy can occur via Posts, images or videos, including live video. 

We define suicide to be the act of taking one’s own life. We define self-harm to include:

* self-inflicted physical injuries e.g., cutting; and
    
* eating disorders e.g., bulimia, anorexia.  
     
    

Violations of this policy include, but are not limited to:  

* encouraging someone to physically harm or kill themselves;
    
* asking others for encouragement to engage in self-harm or suicide, including seeking partners for group suicides or suicide games; and
    
* sharing information, strategies, methods or instructions that would assist people to engage in self-harm and suicide.  
     

### What is not a violation of this policy? 

Some examples of behavior that are not considered a violation of this policy include: 

* sharing personal stories and experiences related to self-harm or suicide;
    
* sharing coping mechanisms and resources for addressing self-harm or suicidal thoughts; and
    
* discussions that are focused on research, advocacy, and education related to self-harm or suicide prevention.  
     
    

**Note**: people can share their personal experiences, but should avoid sharing detailed information about specific strategies or methods related to self-harm, as this could inadvertently encourage this behavior.  
 

### Who can report violations of this policy? 

Anyone can report content that may encourage or promote suicide or self-harm via our in-app reporting or our [specialized reporting form](https://help.x.com/forms/suicide). These reports are routed to a dedicated team who evaluate each case individually. 

Note: if we receive a report that someone has expressed an intention to engage in self-harm or suicide, we will contact them directly, encourage them to seek support, and provide information about dedicated online and hotline resources. We may also work with law enforcement officials where appropriate, for example, if we receive a valid emergency disclosure request as defined in our [Law Enforcement Guidelines](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-law-enforcement-support).  
 

### How to report violations of this policy 

To ensure that we handle reports sensitively, our in-app reporting provides separate options for people who may be expressing an intention to harm themselves, and content that is encouraging or promoting self-harm or suicide.  
 

### Expressing intentions of self-harm or suicide

### What happens if you violate this policy? 

Our enforcement approach depends on the type of content being shared, whether or not the reported account is encouraging or promoting self-harm or suicide, and the account’s previous history of violations. 

If you violate this policy by sharing content that intentionally encourages others to harm themselves, ask others to encourage you to harm yourself, or share detailed information or instructions related to self-harm or suicide methods, we will require you to remove this content. We will also temporarily lock you out of your account before you can Post again. If you continue to violate this policy, or if your account is dedicated to promoting or encouraging self-harm or suicide, your account will be permanently suspended. If cases include images or videos related to self-harm or suicide, we will also evaluate this content under [our sensitive media policy](https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies/media-policy). If you believe that your account was suspended in error, [you can submit an appeal](https://help.x.com/forms/general?subtopic=suspended).  

We may also take steps to prevent the spread of instructional material hosted on third-party websites by [marking such links as unsafe](https://help.x.com/en/safety-and-security/phishing-spam-and-malware-links).

Adult Content

**May 2024**

**You may share consensually produced and distributed adult nudity or sexual behavior, provided it's properly labeled and not prominently displayed.**

We believe that users should be able to create, distribute, and consume material related to sexual themes as long as it is consensually produced and distributed. Sexual expression, whether visual or written, can be a legitimate form of artistic expression. We believe in the autonomy of adults to engage with and create content that reflects their own beliefs, desires, and experiences, including those related to sexuality. We balance this freedom by restricting exposure to Adult Content for children or adult users who choose not to see it. We also prohibit content promoting exploitation, nonconsent, objectification, sexualization or harm to minors, and obscene behaviors. We also do not allow sharing Adult Content in highly visible places such as profile photos or banners.  

How we define Adult Content  

Adult Content is any consensually produced and distributed material depicting adult nudity or sexual behavior that is pornographic or intended to cause sexual arousal. This also applies to AI-generated, photographic or animated content such as cartoons, hentai, or anime. Examples include depictions of:

* full or partial nudity, including close-ups of genitals, buttocks, or breasts;  
    
* explicit or implied sexual behavior or simulated acts such as sexual intercourse and other sexual acts.

### Learn more about our enforcement

Restricted Reach 

You’re allowed to post Adult Content provided it’s properly labeled with a content warning so users who do not wish to see it can avoid it. This also means children below the age of 18 are not exposed to it. If you post content that includes any of the following categories, you need to label your content. 

Adult Nudity

* visible genitals or anus exposed or focused on or when prominently featured; 
    
* visible female nipples;
    
* fully nude butts.
    

Sexual Behavior

* explicit sexual activity including vaginal, oral or anal sex, usage of sex toys or any form of sexual penetration;
    
* implied sexual activity including clothed sexual simulation, states of sexual arousal such as erection or sexual activity that is pixelated, blurred, or strategically covered;
    
* bodily fluids used in sexual context. 
    

Allowed

The following content is not considered Adult Content and does not need a content warning:

* educational content such as breast cancer awareness;
    
* medical content such as post-surgery media of breast augmentation or mastectomy;
    
* partial or digitally obscured nudity such as modeling or beach photos;
    
* activist campaigns carried out with nudity;
    
* artistic nudity or sexual behavior, including paintings, drawings, sculptures, or statues;
    
* parody or satire to convey a political idea, or lobby criticism, such as caricatures or cartoons; 
    
* humor about certain phenomena or theme with no intent to cause sexual arousal such as memes. 
    

Not Allowed  

You can’t include Adult Content within areas that are highly visible on X, including in live video, profile pictures, headers, List banners, or Community cover photos. Such content must be removed and subsequent violations may result in the account being placed in read-only mode or suspended. 

Adult Content must also comply with all X rules that result in content removal or account suspensions, including:

* [Non-consensual nudity](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/intimate-media)
    
* [Promoting or soliciting sexual services](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/regulated-goods-services) 
    
* [Child sexual exploitation](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/sexual-exploitation-policy) 
    
* [Violent sexual conduct](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/violent-speech)
    
* [Unwanted sexual content & graphic objectification](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/abusive-behavior)
    
* [Bestiality and necrophilia](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/violent-speech) 
    

How to mark your content 

If you regularly post adult content on X, we ask that you please [adjust](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/media-settings) your media settings. Doing so places all your images and videos behind a content warning that needs to be acknowledged before your media can be viewed. You can also add a one-time content warning on individual posts. If you continue to fail marking your posts, we will adjust your account settings for you. 

Users under 18 or viewers who do not include a birth date on their profile cannot click to view marked content. Learn more about age restricted content [here](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/notices-on-twitter.html). 

You may begin to see new media content warnings on posts that X has designated as containing Adult Content (instead of a generic sensitive media label). When these new content warnings are available for you to use, please be sure to continue marking your media accordingly.  

How to report 

Anyone can report unmarked content or other violations using our dedicated in-app reporting flow.

Illegal or certain regulated goods or services
==============================================

### Overview

**You may not use our service for any unlawful purpose or in furtherance of illegal activities. This includes selling, buying, or facilitating transactions in illegal goods or services, as well as certain types of regulated goods or services.**  

X takes the safety of our users seriously. In an effort to address the potential for real-world harm, we do not allow the use of X for any unlawful behavior or to further illegal activities. This includes selling, buying, or facilitating transactions in illegal goods or services, as well as certain types of regulated goods or services.

* counterfeit goods and services\*;
* drugs and controlled substances;

### What happens if you violate this policy? 

If we determine that you violated this policy, we may suspend your account, including upon first review.

Accounts that appear to be using misleading account information in order to engage in spamming, abusive, or disruptive behavior to promote the sale of illegal and regulated goods and/or services may be subject to suspension under our [platform manipulation and spam](https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies/platform-manipulation) policy.

Private Content
===============

### Overview 

**March 2024**

**You may not threaten to expose, incentivize others to expose, or publish or post other people's private information without their express authorization and permission, or share private media of individuals without their consent.**  

Sharing someone’s private information online without their permission, sometimes called “doxxing,” is a breach of their privacy and can pose serious safety and security risks for those affected.  
 

Additionally, posting images is an important part of our users' experience on X. However, where individuals have a reasonable expectation of privacy in an individual piece of media, we believe they should be able to determine whether or not it is shared. When we are notified by individuals depicted, or their authorized representative, that they did not consent to having media shared, we will remove the media. This policy is not applicable to public figures.   
 

Lastly, having sexual, nude, or intimate media shared without express consent not only severely violates someone’s privacy and psychological safety, but can lead to physical, emotional, and financial hardship and we work tirelessly to remove this content immediately.  
 

**When reviewing reports under our Private Content policies, we consider a number of things, including:**  
 

* **What type of information is being shared?** Certain types of private information carry higher risks than others, if they’re shared without permission. Our primary goal is to protect individuals from potential physical harm as a result of their information being shared, so we consider information such as physical location and phone numbers to be a higher risk than other types of information.  
     
    
* **Who is sharing the information?** It’s important to consider who is sharing the reported information and whether or not they have the consent of the person it belongs to. We know there are times when people may want some forms of their personal information to be shared publicly, such as for professional networking, coordinating social events, or seeking help after a natural disaster.   
     
    
* **Is the information available elsewhere online?** If the reported information was shared somewhere else before it was shared on X, such as someone sharing their personal phone number on their own publicly accessible website, we may not consider this information to be private, as the owner has made it publicly available elsewhere. However, we may take action against home addresses being shared, even if they are publicly available, due to the potential for physical harm.   
     
    
* **Why is the information being shared?** The intent of the person sharing the information is also important to assess before taking action. For example, if we believe that someone is sharing information with abusive intent, or to harass another person, we will take action. On the other hand, if someone is sharing information in an effort to help someone involved in a crisis situation, we may not take action.
    

### What is in violation of this policy?

### Posting Private Information

You cannot share the following types of private information without the permission of the person it belongs to:

* home address or physical location information, such as street addresses, GPS coordinates, or other identifying information related to locations that are considered private

* health-related private information, such as biometric data or medical records

* the identity of an anonymous user, such as their name or media depicting them

The following behaviors are also not permitted:

* sharing information that would enable individuals to hack or gain access to someone’s private information without their consent, such as sharing login credentials for online banking services
    
* asking for or offering a bounty or financial reward in exchange for posting someone’s private information
    
* asking for a bounty or financial reward in exchange for not posting someone’s private information, sometimes referred to as blackmail.
    

### Non-Consensual Nudity

You cannot share sexual, nude, or intimate media (photos/videos) without the permission of the person involved, or that was taken or appears to have been taken without the consent of the people involved. This includes:

* hidden camera content featuring nudity, partial nudity, and/or sexual acts
    
* creepshots or upskirts - images or videos taken of people’s buttocks, up an individual’s skirt/dress or other clothes that allows people to see the person’s genitals, buttocks, or breasts
    
* images or videos that superimpose or otherwise digitally manipulate an individual’s face onto another person’s nude body
    
* images or videos that are taken in an intimate setting and not intended for public distribution
    

The following behaviors are also not permitted:

* threatening to publicly expose someone’s sexual, nude, or intimate media
    
* sharing information that would enable individuals to hack or gain access to someone’s sexual, nude, or intimate media without their consent, such as sharing login credentials for a private photo album
    
* asking for or offering a bounty or financial reward in exchange for posting someone’s sexual, nude, or intimate media
    
* asking for a bounty or financial reward in exchange for not posting someone’s sexual, nude, or intimate media, sometimes referred to as blackmail.
    

Right to Privacy

You cannot share media (photos/videos) of private individuals without the permission of the person(s) depicted.

### What is not a violation of this policy? 

### Posting Private Information

The following are not in violation of this policy:

* people sharing their own private information
    
* sharing information that is publicly available elsewhere, in a non-abusive manner
    
* sharing identity documents or social security or other national identity numbers from regions where this information is not considered to be private
    
* sharing information that we don’t consider to be private, including:
    
    * names
        
    * birthdates or ages
        
    * places of education or employment
        
    * location information related to commercial properties or places of business, where this information is publicly available
        
    * descriptions of physical appearance
        
    * gossip, rumors, accusations, and allegations
        
    * screenshots of text messages or messages from other platforms (unless they contain private information, such as someone’s phone number).
        

### Non-Consensual Nudity

Pornography and other forms of consensually-produced adult content are allowed on X, provided you mark the post or [mark your account as sensitive](https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies/media-settings.html). Doing so provides people who may not want to see this type of content with a warning that they will need to acknowledge before viewing your media. If you don’t mark your media as sensitive, we may do so manually if your content is reported for review. 

### Right to Privacy

The following are not in violation of this policy:

* the media is publicly available or is being covered by mainstream media
    
* the media and the accompanying tweet text add value to the public discourse or are shared in public interest
    
* the media contains eyewitness accounts or on the ground reports from developing events
    
* the subject of the media is a public figure. 
    

### Who can report violations of this policy? 

### Posting Private Information

Anyone can report violations of this policy using our dedicated reporting flow when the private information has been shared in a clearly abusive way. When this isn’t the case, we may need to hear directly from the owner of the private information (or an authorized representative, such as a lawyer) before taking action. 

### Non-Consensual Nudity

Due to X allowing some types of adult content on the platform, we may need additional context to determine if the content was created or shared without the consent of those involved. This means we may need to hear directly from the individual(s) featured (or an authorized representative, such as a lawyer) to ensure that we have sufficient context before taking any enforcement action.

However, to reduce the burden on those affected by non-consensual media, anyone can report the following types of content:

* creepshots or upskirts
    
* content where a bounty or financial reward is offered in exchange for non-consensual nudity media
    
* intimate images or videos that are accompanied by text that wishes/hopes for harm to come to those depicted or otherwise refers to revenge, such as “I hope you get what you deserve when people see this”
    
* intimate images or videos that are accompanied by information that could be used to contact those depicted, such as “you can tell my ex what you think by calling them at 123-456-7890.”
    

### Right to Privacy

When reporting private media, we need a first person report in order to make the determination that the image or video has been shared without their permission. We accept reports from: 

* the individuals depicted in the reported media or
    
* their authorized representative, such as:
    
    * parents/legal guardians
        
    * lawyers
        
    * legal representatives.
        

### What happens if you violate this policy?  

When determining the penalty for violating this policy, we consider a number of factors including, but not limited to the severity of the violation and an individual’s previous record of rule violations. The following is a list of potential enforcement options for content that violates this policy:

* Requiring post removal.
    
    * For example, we may ask someone to remove the violating content and serve a period of time in read-only mode before they can post again. Subsequent violations may lead to account suspension.
        
* Suspending accounts whose sole purpose is to post others’ private information or media of any kind. This includes accounts dedicated to sharing upskirt or creepshot media.
    

Learn more about our [range of enforcement options](https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies/enforcement-options.html). If someone believes their posts or account were enforced against in error, they can [submit an appeal](https://help.x.com/forms/account-access/appeals.html).

Non-consensual nudity policy
============================

### Overview

**  
December 2021**

**You may not post or share intimate photos or videos of someone that were produced or distributed without their consent.**

Sharing explicit sexual images or videos of someone online without their consent is a severe violation of their privacy and the [X Rules](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-rules.html). Sometimes referred to as revenge porn, this content poses serious safety and security risks for people affected and can lead to physical, emotional, and financial hardship.  
  

### What is a violation of this policy?

  
Under this policy, you can’t post or share explicit images or videos that were taken, appear to have been taken or that were shared without the consent of the people involved.

Examples of the types of content that violate this policy include, but are not limited to:  

* hidden camera content featuring nudity, partial nudity, and/or sexual acts;
* creepshots or upskirts - images or videos taken of people’s buttocks, up an individual’s skirt/dress or other clothes that allows people to see the person’s genitals, buttocks, or breasts; 
* images or videos that superimpose or otherwise digitally manipulate an individual’s face onto another person’s nude body; 
* images or videos that are taken in an intimate setting and not intended for public distribution; and
* offering a bounty or financial reward in exchange for intimate images or videos.  
     

### What is not a violation of this policy?

  
Pornography and other forms of consensually produced adult content are allowed on X, provided that this media is marked as sensitive. Doing so provides people who may not want to see this type of content with a warning that they will need to acknowledge before viewing your media. 

To mark your media as sensitive, navigate to your [safety settings](https://twitter.com/settings/safety) and select the **Mark media you post as containing material that may be sensitive** option. If you don’t mark your media as sensitive, we may do so manually if your content is reported for review.   
  

### Who can report violations of this policy?

  
Because X allows some types of adult content, we need to evaluate context to assess if reported content has been created or shared without the consent of those involved.   
 

**Content reportable by anyone**

We recognize that it can be difficult for those impacted to report this type of content for review. To reduce the burden on those affected, anyone can report the following types of content:

* creepshots or upskirts;
* content where a bounty or financial reward is offered in exchange for non-consensual nudity media; and
* intimate images or videos that are accompanied by:
* text that wishes/hopes for harm to come to those depicted or otherwise refers to revenge e.g., “I hope you get what you deserve when people see this”; and
* information that could be used to contact those depicted e.g., “You can tell my ex what you think by calling them on 1234567”.  
     

**Content reportable by featured individual(s)**

For other types of content, we may need to hear directly from the individual(s) featured (or an authorized representative, such as a lawyer) to ensure that we have sufficient context before taking any enforcement action.   
 

### How can I report violations of this policy?

**  
In-app**

You can report this content for review in-app as follows:

1. Select **Report post** from the  icon.
2. Select **It displays a sensitive photo or video**.

You can also report this content via [our private information report form](https://help.x.com/en/forms/safety-and-sensitive-content/private-information.html), by selecting the **An unauthorized photo or video** option.  
 

### What happens if you violate this policy?

  
We will **immediately and permanently suspend any account that we identify as the original poster of intimate media** that was created or shared without consent. We will do the same with any account that posts only this type of content, e.g., accounts dedicated to sharing upskirt images.

In other cases, we may not suspend an account immediately. This is because some people share this content inadvertently, to express shock, disbelief or to denounce this practice. In these cases, we will require you to remove this content. We will also temporarily lock you out of your account before you can post again. If you violate this policy again after your first warning, your account will be permanently suspended. If you believe that your account was suspended in error, you can [submit an appeal](https://help.x.com/en/forms/account-access/appeals.html).

Platform manipulation and spam policy
=====================================

### Overview

**  
March 2023**

**You may not use X's services in a manner intended to artificially amplify or suppress information or engage in behavior that manipulates or disrupts people’s experience or platform manipulation defenses on X.**

We want X to be a place where people can make human connections, find reliable information, and express themselves freely and safely. To make that possible, we do not allow spam or other types of platform manipulation. We define platform manipulation as using X to engage in bulk, aggressive, or deceptive activity that misleads others and/or disrupts their experience.  

Platform manipulation can take many forms and our rules are intended to address a wide range of prohibited behavior, including:  

* commercially-motivated spam, that typically aims to drive traffic or attention from a conversation on X to accounts, websites, products, services, or initiatives;
* inauthentic engagements, that attempt to make accounts or content appear more popular or active than they are;
* coordinated activity, that attempts to artificially influence conversations through the use of multiple accounts, fake accounts, automation and/or scripting;
* coordinated harmful activity that encourages or promotes behavior which violates [Our Rules](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-rules.html); and
* leveraging X's open source code to circumvent remediations or platform defenses.

Civic integrity policy
======================

### Overview

### **August 2023**

**You may not use X’s services for the purpose of manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes, such as posting or sharing content that may suppress participation, mislead people about when, where, or how to participate in a civic process, or lead to offline violence during an election.** Any attempt to undermine the integrity of civic participation undermines our core tenets of freedom of expression and as a result, we will apply labels to violative posts informing users that the content is misleading.

**What is a civic process?** 

X considers civic processes to be events or procedures mandated, organized, and conducted by the governing and/or electoral body of a country, state, region, district, or municipality to address a matter of common concern through public participation. Some examples of civic processes may include: 

* Political elections
* Censuses 
* Major referenda and ballot initiatives   
     

**What is in violation of this policy?**

This policy addresses 4 categories of misleading behavior and content: 

**Misleading information about how to participate**

You may not advance verifiably false or misleading information about how to participate in an election or other civic process. This includes but is not limited to:

* misleading information about procedures to participate in a civic process (for example, that you can vote by Post, text message, email, or phone call in jurisdictions where these are not a possibility);
* misleading information about requirements for participation, including identification or citizenship requirements;
* misleading claims that cause confusion about the established laws, regulations, procedures, and methods of a civic process, or about the actions of officials or entities executing those civic processes; and
* misleading statements or information about the official, announced date or time of a civic process.

**Suppression**

You may not advance verifiably false or misleading information about the circumstances surrounding a civic process intended to intimidate or dissuade people from participating in an election or other civic process. This includes but is not limited to:

* misleading claims that polling places are closed, that polling has ended, or other misleading information relating to votes not being counted; 
    
* misleading claims about police or law enforcement activity related to voting in an election, polling places, or collecting census information; 
    
* misleading claims about long lines, equipment problems, or other disruptions at voting locations during election periods;
    

**Intimidation**

You may not engage in or promote behaviors that may coerce others to refrain from participating in a civic process. This includes, but is not limited to:

* inciting or promoting violent behaviors intentionally near a location where an electoral process is being conducted, including polling stations and vote counting locations;
    
* inciting the disruption or destruction of procedures, infrastructure, or election equipment that is necessary for someone to participate in a civic process;
    
* inciting others to harass voters or poll workers;
    
* promoting the brandishing of firearms near polling locations to intimidate voters and election workers;
    
* threats regarding voting locations or other key places or events (note that our [Violent Speech](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/violent-speech) policy may also be relevant for threats not covered by this policy).

**False or misleading affiliation**

You may not create fake accounts which misrepresent their affiliation, or share content that falsely represents its affiliation, to a candidate, elected official, political party, electoral authority, or government entity. Read more about our [Misleading and deceptive identities policy](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-impersonation-and-deceptive-identities-policy.html).

**What is not a violation of this policy?**

Not all false or untrue information about politics or civic processes constitutes manipulation or interference. In the absence of other policy violations, the following are generally not in violation of this policy:

* inaccurate statements about an elected or appointed official, candidate, or political party; 
    
* organic content that is polarizing, biased, hyperpartisan, or contains controversial viewpoints expressed about elections or politics; 
    
* discussion of public polling information; voting and audience participation for competitions, game shows, or other entertainment purposes; 
    
* using X pseudonymously or as a [parody, commentary, or fan account](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-impersonation-and-deceptive-identities-policy) to discuss elections or politics.

**What happens if you violate this policy?**

Posts that are enforced under this policy will have their reach restricted on X by:   

* Excluding the post from search results, trends, and recommended notifications
    
* Removing the post from the For you and Following timelines
    
* Restricting the post's discoverability to the author’s profile
    
* Restricting Likes, replies, reposts, quotes, bookmarks, share, pin to profile, or Edit post
    
* Downranking the Post in replies 
    

Posts enforced under this policy will receive a label informing both Post authors and viewers that we have limited the Post’s visibility. Post authors are able to submit an appeal on the label if they think we incorrectly limited their Post’s visibility. Learn more about our [range of enforcement options](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/enforcement-options.html).

Misleading and deceptive identities policy
==========================================

Overview
--------

April 2023
==========

**You may not misappropriate the identity of individuals, groups, or organizations or use a fake identity to deceive others.**
==============================================================================================================================

We want X to be a place where people can find authentic voices. While you are not required to display your real name or image on your profile, your account should not use false profile information to represent itself as a person or entity that is not affiliated with the account owner, such that it may mislead others who use X.

Synthetic and manipulated media policy
======================================

### Overview 

### April 2023

**You may not share synthetic, manipulated, or out-of-context media that may deceive or confuse people and lead to harm (“misleading media”). In addition, we may label posts containing misleading media to help people understand their authenticity and to provide additional context.**

Trademark policy
================

### Overview

### **April 2023**

**  
You may not violate others’ intellectual property rights, including copyright and trademark.**

A trademark is a word, logo, phrase, or device that distinguishes a trademark holder’s good or service in the marketplace. Trademark law may prevent others from using a trademark in an unauthorized or confusing manner.    
  

### What is in violation of this policy? 

Using another’s trademark in a way that may mislead or confuse people about your affiliation may be a violation of our trademark policy.  
 

### What is not a violation of this policy? 

Referencing another’s trademark is not automatically a violation of X's trademark policy. Examples of non-violations include:

* using a trademark in a way that is outside the scope of the trademark registration e.g., in a different territory, or a different class of goods or services than that identified in the registration; and
* using a trademark in a nominative or other fair use manner. For more information, see our [Misleading and deceptive identities policy](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-impersonation-and-deceptive-identities-policy.html).[](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-impersonation-and-deceptive-identities-policy.html)

Username squatting policy
=========================

Username squatting is prohibited by the [X Rules](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-rules.html).

Please note that if an account has had no updates, no profile image, and there is no intent to mislead, it typically means there's no name-squatting or impersonation. Note that we will not release squatted usernames except in cases of trademark infringement. If your report involves [trademark infringement](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-trademark-policy.html), please consult those policies for instructions for reporting these accounts.   

Attempts to sell, buy, or solicit other forms of payment in exchange for usernames are also violations and may result in permanent account suspension.

Copypasta and duplicate content policy
======================================

### Overview  
  
  
May 2022

In order to help people find credible and authentic information, and to promote a healthy public discourse on X, we limit the visibility of duplicative (or also known as ‘copypasta’) Posts.

Financial scam policy
=====================

### Overview

**  
September 2019**

**You may not use X's services in a manner intended to artificially amplify or suppress information or engage in behavior that manipulates or disrupts people’s experience on X.**

We want X to be a place where people can make human connections and find reliable information. For this reason, you may not use X's services to deceive others into sending you money or personal financial information via scam tactics, phishing, or otherwise fraudulent or deceptive methods.

### What is in violation of this policy?

  
Using scam tactics on X to obtain money or private financial information is prohibited under this policy. You are not allowed to create accounts, publish posts, or send Direct Messages that solicit engagement in such fraudulent schemes. Examples of prohibited, deceptive tactics include:

* **Relationship/trust-building scams.** You may not deceive others into sending you money or personal financial information by operating a fake account or by posing as a public figure or an organization.  
    
* **Money-flipping schemes.** You may not engage in “money flipping” schemes (for example, guaranteeing to send someone a large amount of money in return for a smaller initial payment via a wire transfer or prepaid debit card).
* **Fraudulent discounts.** You may not operate schemes which make discount offers to others wherein fulfillment of the offers is paid for using stolen credit cards and/or stolen financial credentials.
* **Phishing scams.** You may not pose as or imply affiliation with banks or other financial institutions to acquire others’ personal financial information. Keep in mind that other forms of phishing to obtain such information are also in violation of our platform manipulation and spam policy.

### What is not a violation of this policy?

  
As described above, X takes action on accounts that engage in deceptive scam, phishing or other fraud tactics. X does not intervene in financial disputes between individuals who use X, such as: 

* Claims relating to the sale of goods on X.
* Disputed refunds from individuals or brands.
* Complaints of poor quality goods received.

### Who can report violations of this policy?  

  
Anyone can report accounts or posts via our dedicated reporting flow. These reports are used in aggregate to help refine our enforcement systems and identify new and emerging trends and patterns of behavior, and you may not receive an individual response to your report.

### How can I report violations of this policy?  

**  
In-app**  

You can report this content for review in-app as follows:

1. Select **Report Post** from the  icon.
2. Select **It’s suspicious or spam**.
3. Select the option that best tells us how the Post is suspicious or spreading spam.
4. Submit your report.  
     

**Desktop**

You can report this content on desktop as follows:

1. Select **Report Post** from the  icon.
2. Select **It’s suspicious or spam**.
3. Select the option that best tells us how the Post is suspicious or spreading spam.
4. Submit your report.

### What happens if you violate this policy?  

  
The consequences for violating this policy depend on the type and severity of the violation as well as any previous history of violations. The actions we take may include the following:  
 

**Anti-spam challenges**

When we detect suspicious levels of activity, accounts may be locked and prompted to provide additional information (e.g., a phone number) or to solve a reCAPTCHA.   
 

**Blacklisting URLs**

We blacklist or provide warnings about URLs we believe to be unsafe. Read more about [unsafe links](https://help.x.com/safety-and-security/phishing-spam-and-malware-links), including how to appeal if we’ve falsely identified your URL as unsafe.  
 

**Post deletion and temporary account locks**

If the violation is an isolated incident or first offense, we may take a number of actions ranging from requiring deletion of one or more posts to temporarily locking account(s). Any subsequent attempts to engage in scam, phishing or other fraud tactics will result in permanent suspension.  
 

**Permanent suspension**

For severe violations, accounts will be permanently suspended at first detection. Examples of severe violations include:

* operating accounts where the majority of behavior is in violation of the policies described above;
* creating accounts to replace or mimic a suspended account.

### Additional resources

  
Read more about our [platform manipulation and spam](https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies/platform-manipulation) policy.

Abusive profile information
===========================

**[X Rules:](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-rules.html#hateful-conduct)** You may not use your username, display name, or profile bio to engage in abusive behavior, such as targeted harassment or expressing hate towards a person, group, or protected category.  
 

### Rationale  

While we want people to feel free to express their individuality in their profile names and descriptions, we have found that accounts with abusive profile information usually indicate abusive intent and strongly correlate with abusive behavior. The high visibility of profile names and descriptions also means that people might involuntarily find themselves exposed to threatening or abusive content when visiting a profile page.    
 

### When this applies  

We will review and take enforcement action against accounts that target an individual, group of people, or a protected category with any of the following behavior in their profile information, i.e., usernames, display names, or profile bios:

* Violent threats
* Abusive slurs, epithets, racist, or sexist tropes
* Abusive content that reduces someone to less than human
* Content that incites fear

We will not consider insults under this policy. However, we will still take action against these accounts if we receive reports about posts or Direct Messages that are in violation of our other policies. As always, context matters when we evaluate for abusive behavior and in determining appropriate enforcement actions.  

**  
Do I need to be the target of this content for it to be a violation of the X Rules?**  
No, we review both first-person and bystander reports of such content.  
 

### Consequences 

If an account’s profile information includes any of the abusive behaviors listed above, we will permanently suspend the account on first violation.  

If an account uses a hateful symbol in its profile information, the account-holder will be required to remove the symbol before they can use their account again. Repeated violations will lead to permanent suspension. For more information on how we handle hateful imagery and symbols, see our [media policy](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/media-policy.html).  

If someone believes their account was suspended in error, they can [submit an appeal](https://help.x.com/forms/general?subtopic=suspended).

Automated copyright claims for live video
=========================================

X and Periscope are testing technology designed to help copyright owners find and control unauthorized uses of their content on our platforms.

X and Periscope broadcasts that match copyrighted content may be disabled or have limited visibility.

Counterfeit policy
==================

X prohibits the sale of or promoting the sale of counterfeit goods on the platform.

About public-interest exceptions on X
=====================================

### Defining the public interest

X has clear policies on content and behavior that violates X rules and we take the appropriate action against content and accounts that violate our rules. However, we recognize that sometimes it may be in the public interest to allow people to view posts that would otherwise violate our policies. We consider content to be in the public interest if it directly contributes to understanding or discussion of a matter of public concern.  
  
In certain and rare instances, we may choose to leave up a post from an elected or government official that would otherwise violate our policies, given the significant public interest in knowing and being able to discuss their actions and statements. Instead we will place it behind a notice providing context about the rule violation that allows people to click through to see the post. Placing a post behind this notice also limits the ability to engage with the post through likes, Reposts, or sharing on X, and makes sure the post isn't algorithmically recommended by X. These actions are meant to limit the post’s reach while maintaining the public’s ability to view and discuss it.

About X limits
==============

### Why have limits? 

Limits alleviate some of the strain on the behind-the-scenes part of X and reduce downtime and error pages. For the sake of reliability, we've placed some limits on the account actions below.  
 

### Current X limits 

The current technical limits for accounts are:

* **Direct Messages (daily)**: The limit is 500 messages sent per day.
* **posts**: 2,400 per day. The daily update limit is further broken down into smaller limits for semi-hourly intervals. Reposts are counted as posts.
* **Changes to account email**: 4 per hour.
* **Following (daily)**: The technical follow limit is 400 per day. Please note that this is a technical account limit only, and there are additional rules prohibiting aggressive following behavior. 
* **Following (account-based)**: Once an account is following 5,000 other accounts, additional follow attempts are limited by account-specific ratios. 

These limits include actions from all devices, including web, mobile, phone, API, etc. API requests from all third-party applications are tracked against the hourly API limit. People who use multiple third-party applications with their account will therefore reach the API limit more quickly. 

These limits may be temporarily reduced during periods of heavy site usage. In such cases, we will post an update on the [X status](https://status.twitterstat.us/) site.  
 

### What happens if I hit a limit? 

If you do reach a limit, we'll let you know with an error message telling you which limit you've hit. For limits that are time-based (like the Direct Messages, posts, changes to account email, and API request limits), you'll be able to try again after the time limit has elapsed.

The post limit of 2,400 updates per day is further broken down into semi-hourly intervals. If you hit your account update/post limit, please try again in a few hours after the limit period has elapsed.  
 

### Having trouble? 

If you've hit a follow limit, please see this [follow limit troubleshooting](https://help.x.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-follow-limit.html) article for more information.

About specific instances when a post’s reach may be limited
===========================================================

People may express themselves on X as long as they do not violate our [X Rules](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-rules.html). **We do not block, limit, or remove content based on an individual’s views or opinions. In some situations, your post may not be seen by everyone, as outlined below:**   

**1\. Violation of the X Rules**

Where appropriate, we will restrict the reach of posts that violate our policies and create a negative experience for other users by making the post less discoverable on X.  Learn more here about our [range of enforcement options](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/enforcement-options).

**2\. Tools and controls**

We’ve developed a set of tools that enable people to control what they see on X.  

* Block — Block enables people to prevent someone from seeing their content or contacting them when logged in to X.  
    
* Mute — Mute enables people to avoid content they don’t want to see without letting other people know they’ve been muted. People can mute other accounts, specific keywords from appearing in Notifications, their Home timeline, and entire conversations. 
* Notification filters — We enable people to filter their notifications so they do not need to see posts from certain types of accounts, like those without a profile photo, unverified email address or phone numbers, and from accounts they do not follow. 

**3. Quality and safety ranking  
**

We are constantly working on improving core parts of the X experience, including the timeline, conversations, and [search](https://help.x.com/content/help-twitter/en/using-twitter/twitter-search) so that people see content that they are most interested in and contributes to the conversation in a meaningful way, such as content that is relevant, credible, and safe.   

We have also developed "safe search" functionality which removes posts that contain potentially sensitive content and posts from blocked and muted accounts from search results. As part of this, our team has been working on identifying and collapsing potentially abusive and low-quality replies so the most relevant conversations are brought forward. These post replies are still accessible to those who seek them out. 

We use a variety of behavior-based signals to inform how we rank content, such as who you follow, what conversations you join, and if someone is muted or blocked and by whom. For example, if you post to a number of accounts and they block or mute you, we have a strong signal that those accounts do not want to see your posts. Or, if everyone responds when you mention them in a post that demonstrates to us that they want to join the conversation. No one signal is used in isolation – the system uses many signals to continually determine how each account should be ranked.

**4\. Experiments**

We are constantly running experiments on X which may limit the reach of certain posts. If we decide to make a feature or experience generally available, we will update the community and this Help Center page.

**5\. Legal, quality, and technical issues**

We may limit a post’s reach if it violates our [X Rules](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-rules.html) or applicable laws, or is determined to be low quality. For more information on instances where we may withhold a post in a specific country, please see this Help Center [article](https://help.x.com/en/safety-and-security/tweet-withheld-by-country.html).  

Some people report issues related to their posts not appearing on X or their replies detaching from an original post that happen outside of enforcement actions and safety features. These cases may be the result of a post being identified as spam by our systems or may be due to some current technical issues and limitations of the service. We use @Support to update the community about technical issues like these.

If you notice other instances where posts are not appearing, we encourage you to let us know by [reporting the issue](https://help.x.com/forms).

Our range of enforcement options
================================

When we take enforcement actions, we may do so either on a specific piece of content (e.g., an individual post or Direct Message), on an account, or employ a combination of these options. In some instances, this is because the behavior violates the [X Rules](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-rules.html). Other times, it may be in response to a valid legal request from an authorized entity in a given country. Below are some of the enforcement actions that we may take.  
 

**Post-level enforcement**

We take action at the post level when a specific post violates the X Rules, including posts that share or reproduce other posts by posting screenshots, quote-posting, or sharing post URLs that violate our Rules.

A few of the ways in which we might take action at the post level include:

**Limiting post visibility:** Where appropriate, we will restrict the reach of posts that violate our policies and create a negative experience for other users by making the post less  discoverable on X. This can include:

* Excluding the post from search results, trends, and recommended notifications
    
* Removing the post from the For you and Following timelines
    
* Restricting the post’s discoverability to the author’s profile
    
* Downranking the post in replies
    
* Restricting Likes, replies, Reposts, Quote posts, bookmarks, share, pin to profile, or Edit post
    

**Excluding the post from having ads adjacent to it:** Starting in April 2023, posts identified as violating our Rules will begin to receive labels informing both post authors and viewers that we limited the post’s visibility.   

Authors will be able to submit an appeal on the label if they think we incorrectly limited their post’s visibility. 

**Requiring post removal:**  When we determine that a post violated the X Rules and the violation is severe enough to warrant post removal, we will require the violator to remove it before they can post again. They will need to go through the process of removing the violating post or [appealing](https://help.x.com/en/forms/account-access/appeals.html) our removal request if they believe we made an error. The post will be hidden from public view with a [notice](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/notices-on-x.html) during this process. 

**Labeling a post:** If we determine a post contains misleading or disputed information per our policies that could potentially lead to harm, we may [add a label](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/notices-on-x.html) to the content to provide context and additional information to users. In these cases, [Community Notes](https://help.x.com/en/using-twitter/community-notes.html) may also be visible on posts to provide additional context.

**Notice of public interest exception:** We may determine that it is in the public interest for a post that would otherwise be in violation of our rules to remain accessible on our service. When this occurs, we will place the post behind a notice and limit its visibility. [Learn more](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/public-interest.html) about the public interest exception.

### **Direct Message-level enforcement**

Stopping conversations between a reported violator and the reporter’s account: In a private Direct Message conversation, when a participant reports the other account, we will stop the violator from sending messages to the account who reported them. The conversation will also be removed from the reporter's inbox. However, if the reporter decides to continue to send Direct Messages to the violator, the conversation will resume.

**Placing a Direct Message behind a notice:** In a group Direct Message conversation, the violating Direct Message may be placed behind a notice to ensure no one else in the group can see it again.

  
**Account-level enforcement**

We take action to suspend an account if we determine that a user has engaged in repeated violations of our policies and/or violated specific policies that cause significant risk to X (i.e. posting illegal content, attempts to manipulate our platform or spam users, using our platform to incite violence, etc.) or pose a threat to our users (fraud, user privacy violations, violent threats, targeted harassment, etc.).

**Placing an account in read-only mode:** We may temporarily limit an account’s ability to post, Repost, or Like. The user can read their timelines and will only be able to send Direct Messages to their followers. 

**Verifying account ownership:** We may require an account owner to verify ownership with a phone number or email address. Note that when an account has been locked pending completion of a challenge (such as being required to provide a phone number), it is removed from follower counts, Reposts, and Likes.

Users can appeal account suspensions if they believe we made an error. They can do this through the platform interface or by [filing a report](https://help.x.com/en/forms/account-access/appeals.html).  
  

### Actions we may take against non-violating content

**Placing a post behind a notice:** We may place some forms of [sensitive media](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/media-policy.html) like adult content or graphic violence behind an interstitial advising viewers to be aware that they will see sensitive media if they click through. Learn more about [how to control whether you see sensitive media](https://help.x.com/en/safety-and-security/sensitive-media.html).

**Withholding a post based on age:** We restrict views of specific forms of sensitive media such as adult content for viewers who are under 18 or viewers who do not include a birth date on their profile with [interstitials](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/notices-on-x.html). 

**Withholding a post or account in a country:** We may withhold access to certain content in a particular country if we receive a valid and properly scoped request from an authorized entity in that country. Read more about [country withheld content](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/tweet-withheld-by-country.html).

X Moments guidelines and principles
===================================

How does X curate Moments?  
 

Out of hundreds of millions of posts a day, Moments surface the best of what’s happening on X. Through Moments, millions of people can enjoy the power of X—at the center of a protest, the front row at the Oscars, on the field at the World Cup, or from outer space. What you see on X is what’s happening in the world.  

Moments are created in multiple ways. Some Moments, such as those covering sporting events or TV shows, are created algorithmically to reflect the unfolding conversation while the event is happening. Others are prepared manually by our Curation team, following standards and guidelines that are explained in more detail below.  
 

### The Curation team 

The Curation team’s goal is to find and highlight great posts, including text, video, GIFs and live streams, that provide insight and context to the conversations happening right now on X. Curators don’t act as reporters or creators of original work, they organize and present compelling content that already exists on X. This content appears in Moments, explanatory content on Trends, in lists and more. 

Our curators are a global, multilingual team looking for the best things happening on X across news, sports, entertainment, and fun. We currently serve 16 markets in five languages (English, Japanese, Arabic, Spanish and Portuguese). Curators receive regular training on accuracy, impartiality, and identifying high-quality content.  
 

### Curation policy 

Impartiality, accuracy and standards

We aim to uphold high standards of accuracy, impartiality and fairness in our curation. 

Moments are intended to feature compelling, original, and diverse content. When selecting posts and video for a Moment, we consider the content and media as well as the avatar and username of the poster. 

* Impartiality: We make data-driven decisions when choosing posts around controversial topics, seeking posts already receiving significant engagement on X. On topics of public debate, we seek to represent a variety of viewpoints whenever feasible. Curators receive ongoing training on impartiality and strive to objectively reflect the conversation as it appears on the platform. 
    

* Accuracy: Our goal is to highlight quality posts that represent accurate information. Our team receives regular training on social media verification practices and most Moments undergo a review process before they are featured. 
    

* Corrections: If we become aware that we have highlighted inaccurate information, we will update the Moment with a visible correction and issue an updated post. In rare cases, we may delete the Moment and post a retraction using the relevant country X account.
    

* Standards: Profanity, violence, nudity and other types of potentially sensitive content are avoided except when it’s necessary to highlight a newsworthy conversation. We will not include content that promotes or depicts illegal conduct. Any Moment that may contain potentially sensitive content will include a warning.  
     
    

### Avoiding conflicts of interest 

Our Curation team isn’t responsible for driving revenue, user growth, or managing X’s partner relationships. We feature posts and videos, and select Moments topics based on what best serves our audience. These decisions aren’t influenced by advertisers, partners, or X’s business interests. 

The Curation team will generally avoid creating Moments that cover our industry, our company, or our competitors. If X, or its competitors, become a significant part of the conversation on the platform (for instance, if the issue becomes a [trending topic](https://help.x.com/using-twitter/twitter-trending-faqs)), our Curation team may curate a factual summary of the conversation, including a response from the company where available.  
 

### Selecting Moments topics 

Moments highlight remarkable posts that are engaging, informative or unique. They should appeal to a broad audience and the content should be appropriate for all parts of the X community. 

Some Moments will reflect world and media events, while others will be based on unique “only on X” content. We select Moments topics based on what people are discussing on X. When curating around controversial topics, we look to demonstrably large conversations on X and big news in the region’s mainstream press.    

We avoid creating Moments that may invade privacy, encourage illegal activities, or exploit or harm minors. Content that violates the X rules will never be featured. We do not duplicate curated collections or sets of posts embedded on third-party websites, or those reposted from a single X account.  
 

### Selecting great posts 

Moments is about highlighting the smart, witty, and innovative content created by people on X. We will be faithful to individual voices when we include them in Moments, and will not include posts in a way that misleads, substantially changes a post’s original context, or includes content from protected accounts. We avoid featuring content created by X employees.   
 

### Annotations 

Some Moments created by the X Curation team may include additional text beneath the title or between posts, called Annotations. This text is meant to add context to the Moment and may be a summary of a developing situation, historical details, or a translation of a post in the Moment. If Annotations are not sourced from a post in the Moment, they should be easily verifiable or attributed to a source.

Fair use policy
===============

Certain uses of copyrighted material may not require the copyright owner’s permission. In the United States, this concept is known as fair use. Some other countries have a similar concept known as fair dealing.

Whether or not a certain use of copyrighted material constitutes a fair use is ultimately determined by a court of law. Courts analyze fair use arguments by looking at four factors:

* The purpose and character of the use.  
    * How is the original work being used, and is the new use commercial? Transformative uses add something to the original work: commentary, criticism, educational explanation or additional context are a few examples. Transformative, non-commercial uses are more likely to be considered fair use.
* The nature of the copied work.
    * What is the copied work itself? Is it factual (example: a record of a historical event) or fictional (example: a novel or Hollywood blockbuster)? Use of factual works weighs in favor of fair use.
* The amount and substantiality of the copied work.
    * How much of the work was copied? Copying short excerpts is more likely to be found fair use than copying an entire copyrighted work.
* The effect on the copied work’s value.
    * Will the copying harm the potential market for the copyrighted work by effectively creating a substitute or replacement for that work?  If so, the use is probably not fair use.

  
Fair use determinations are made on a case by case basis, and there is no clear formula to determine whether a use may be found to be fair. If you are unsure whether a particular use of copyrighted work might be a fair use, you may want to seek legal advice. X is unable to advise whether your use may be considered fair use or not.

Copyright policy
================

#### What types of copyright complaints does X respond to?

X responds to copyright complaints submitted under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”). Section 512 of the DMCA outlines the statutory requirements necessary for formally reporting copyright infringement, as well as providing instructions on how an affected party can appeal a removal by submitting a compliant counter-notice.

X will respond to reports of alleged copyright infringement, such as allegations concerning the unauthorized use of a copyrighted image as a profile or header photo, allegations concerning the unauthorized use of a copyrighted video or image uploaded through our media hosting services, or posts containing links to allegedly infringing materials. Note that not all unauthorized uses of copyrighted materials are infringements (see our [fair use](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/fair-use-policy.html) article for more information).

If you are concerned about the use of your brand or entity’s name, please review [Twitter’s trademark policy](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-trademark-policy.html). If you are concerned about a parody, newsfeed, commentary, or fan account, please see the relevant policy [here](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/parody-account-policy.html). These are generally not copyright issues.

#### Am I a copyright holder? How do I know?

If you are unsure whether you hold rights to a particular work, please consult an attorney or another adviser as X cannot provide legal advice. There are plenty of resources to learn more about copyright law including [http://copyright.gov](http://copyright.gov/) and [http://www.eff.org/issues/bloggers/legal/liability/IP](https://www.eff.org/issues/bloggers/legal/liability/IP), just to name a few.

#### What to consider before submitting a copyright complaint

Before submitting a copyright complaint to us, please consider whether or not the use could be considered [fair use](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/fair-use-policy.html). 

If you have considered fair use, and you still wish to continue with a copyright complaint, you may want to first reach out to the user in question to see if you can resolve the matter directly with the user. You can reply to the user’s post or send the user a Direct Message and ask for them to remove your copyrighted content without having to contact X. 

Prior to submitting a formal complaint with X, please be aware that under 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), you may be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred by us or our users, if you knowingly materially misrepresent that material or activity is infringing. If you are unsure whether the material you are reporting is in fact infringing, you may wish to contact an attorney before filing a notification with us.

Note: In general, the photographer and NOT the subject of a photograph is the actual rights holder of the resulting photograph. If you’re unsure whether or not you own the copyrights to a work, or if you’re infringing upon someone else’s work, please consult an attorney or another advisor.

#### What information do you need to process a copyright complaint?

To submit a notice of claimed copyright infringement, you will need to provide us with the following information:

1. A physical or electronic signature (typing your full name will suffice) of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf;
2. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (e.g., a link to your original work or clear description of the materials allegedly being infringed upon);
3. Identification of the infringing material and information reasonably sufficient to permit X to locate the material on our website or services;
4. Your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address;
5. A statement that you have a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner asserted is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
6. A statement that the information in the complaint is accurate, and, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.  
     

If you are reporting the content of a post, please give us a [direct link](https://help.x.com/en/using-twitter/tweet-and-moment-url.html) to that post. Or please specify if the alleged infringement is in the header, avatar, etc. A LINK TO A PROFILE PAGE IS INSUFFICIENT FOR X TO IDENTIFY INFRINGING MATERIALS.

#### How do I file a copyright complaint?

You can report alleged copyright infringement by visiting X Help Center and [filing a copyright complaint](https://help.x.com/forms/ipi). If you are logged in to x.com, you can visit the X Help Center directly from your X account by clicking the ‘Help’ link located in the sidebar.

Filing a DMCA complaint is the start of a pre-defined legal process. Your complaint will be reviewed for accuracy, validity, and completeness. If your complaint has satisfied these requirements, we will take action on your request - which includes forwarding a full copy of your notice (including your name, address, phone and email address) to the user(s) who posted the allegedly infringing material in question.

If you are concerned about your contact information being forwarded, you may wish to use an agent to report for you.

Please be aware that under 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), you may be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred by us or our users, if you knowingly materially misrepresent that material or activity is infringing. If you are unsure whether the material you are reporting is in fact infringing, you may wish to contact an attorney before filing a copyright complaint.

#### How are claims processed?

We process copyright complaints in the order in which they are received. Once you've submitted your ticket, we will email you a ticket confirmation. If you do not receive a ticket confirmation that means we did not receive your complaint and you should re-submit your complaint. However, please note, submitting duplicate copyright complaints will result in a delay in processing.

If we decide to remove or disable access to the material, we will notify the affected user(s) and provide them with a full copy of the reporter’s complaint (including the provided contact information) along with instructions on how to file a counter-notice.

#### What information gets forwarded to the reported user(s)?

If we remove or disable access to the materials reported in a copyright complaint, the reported user(s) will receive a copy of the complaint, including the reporter’s full name, email, street address, and any other information included in the complaint. 

If you are uncomfortable sharing your contact information with the reported user(s), you may wish to consider appointing an agent to submit your DMCA notice on your behalf. Your agent will be required to submit the DMCA notice with valid contact information, and identify you as the content owner that they are representing. 

#### What happens next?

X's response to copyright complaints may include the removal or restriction of access to allegedly infringing material. If we remove or restrict access to user content in response to a copyright complaint, X will make a good faith effort to contact the affected account holder with information concerning the removal or restriction of access, including a full copy of the complaint, along with instructions for filing a counter-notice.

If you’ve not yet received a copy of the copyright complaint regarding the content removed from your account, please respond to the support ticket we sent you.

In an effort to be as transparent as possible regarding the removal or restriction of access to user-posted content, we clearly mark withheld posts and media to indicate to viewers when content has been withheld (examples below).

  ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22 viewBox=%220 0 530 86%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

  ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22 viewBox=%220 0 350 161%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

#### Why did I receive a copyright complaint?

If you receive a copyright complaint, it means that access to the content described in the complaint has been restricted. Please take the time to read through our correspondence to you, which includes information on the complaint we received as well as instructions on how to file a counter-notice. Please ensure that you are monitoring the email address associated with your X account.

Tip: Removing the material reported in a copyright complaint will not resolve that complaint

#### What if I want to contest the takedown?

If you believe that the materials reported in the copyright complaints  
were misidentified or removed in error, you may send us a [counter-notification(s)](https://help.x.com/en/forms/ipi/dmca-counternotice.html) through our Help Center. A counter-notice is a request for X to reinstate the removed material, and it has legal consequences. Alternatively, you may be able to seek a retraction of the copyright complaint from the reporter.

#### How do I seek a retraction?

The DMCA complaint you received includes the contact information of the reporter. You may want to reach out and ask them to retract their notice using our [retraction form](https://help.x.com/forms/ipi/dmca-retraction). This is the fastest and most efficient means of resolving an unresolved copyright complaint. Alternatively, the reporter can also send a retraction notice to [\[email protected\]](https://help.x.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).  Such notice should include: (1) identification of the material that was disabled, and (2) a statement that the reporter would like to retract their DMCA notice.  A retraction is at the sole discretion of the original reporter, and only that reporter can issue a retraction.  If a portion of your post has been withheld, the violation will not be resolved just by deleting the remaining portion.

#### When should I file a counter-notice?

A counter-notice is a request for X to reinstate the removed material, and is the start of a legal process that has legal consequences.  For example, submitting a counter notice indicates that you consent to the jurisdiction of a U.S. Federal court and that you consent to the disclosure of your personal information to the reporter.

With these considerations in mind, you may file a counter-notice if you believe that this material was misidentified, or you have a good faith belief that the material should not have been removed.  If you’re unsure whether or not you should file a counter-notice, you may want to consult with an attorney.

Tip: Re-posting material removed in response to a copyright complaint may result in permanent account suspension. If you believe the content was removed in error, please file a counter-notice rather than re-posting the material. 

#### What information do you need to process a counter-notice?

To submit a counter-notice, you will need to provide us with the following information:

1. A physical or electronic signature (typing your full name will suffice);
2. Your full name, address (including country), telephone number, and for verification purposes, your X username and associated email;
3. Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled, and the location at which the material appeared before that removal or disabling (the description from the copyright notice will suffice);
4. A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and
5. One of the following jurisdictional consent statements:

(If your address is in the United States) 

“I consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located and I’ll accept service of process from the person who provided notice under 17 U.S.C. 512 (c)(1)(C) or an agent of such person.”

OR

(If your address is outside of the United States) 

"I consent to any judicial district in which X may be found, and I’ll accept service of process from the person who provided notice under 17 U.S.C. 512 (c)(1)(C) or an agent of such person."

To submit a counter-notice, please provide all of the above information using our web form, located [here](https://help.x.com/forms/ipi/dmca-counternotice.html).

#### What happens after I submit a counter-notice?

Upon receipt of a valid counter-notice, we will promptly forward a copy to the person who filed the original notice. This means that the contact information that is submitted in your counter-notice will be shared to the person who filed the original notice. 

If the copyright owner disagrees that the content was removed in error or misidentification, they may pursue legal action against you.  If we do not receive notice within 10 business days that the original reporter is seeking a court order to prevent further infringement of the material at issue, we may replace or cease disabling access to the material that was removed.

We cannot offer any legal advice. Should you have questions, please consult an attorney.

#### Filing a copyright complaint or counter-notice is serious business!

Please think twice before submitting a claim or counter-notice, especially if you are unsure whether you are the actual rights holder or authorized to act on a rights holder’s behalf. There are legal and financial consequences for fraudulent and/or bad faith submissions. Please be sure that you are the actual rights holder, or that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed in error, and that you understand the repercussions of submitting a false claim.

#### What happens if my account receives one or more copyright complaints?

If multiple copyright complaints are received about an account, or other evidence suggests a pattern of repeat infringement, X may suspend that account in accordance with our Repeat Infringer Policy. Our Repeat Infringer Policy takes valid retractions and counter-notices into account. Users suspended under that policy may file a suspension appeal using [this form](https://help.x.com/forms/general?subtopic=suspended).

Additionally, re-posting material that was already removed in response to a copyright complaint, indicating where to access copyrighted material on third party websites, or certain other actions that demonstrate your account is intended solely or primarily to infringe the copyrighted material of others may result in permanent account suspension. If you are suspended on this basis, you may file an appeal using [this form](https://help.x.com/forms/general?subtopic=suspended). Please be aware that appealing a suspension does not guarantee your account will be reinstated.

Our approach to policy development and enforcement philosophy
=============================================================

X is reflective of real conversations happening in the world and that sometimes includes perspectives that may be offensive, controversial, and/or bigoted to others. While we welcome everyone to express themselves on our service, we will not tolerate behavior that harasses, threatens, or uses fear to silence the voices of others.

We have the [X Rules](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-rules.html) in place to help ensure everyone feels safe expressing their beliefs and we strive to enforce them with uniform consistency. Learn more about [different enforcement actions](https://support.twitter.com/articles/20175435).
