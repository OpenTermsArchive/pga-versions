Facebook Community Standards
============================

The Facebook Community Standards outline what is and isn't allowed on Facebook.

### Introduction

Every day, people use Facebook to share their experiences, connect with friends and family, and build communities. It’s a service for more than 2 billion people to freely express themselves across countries and cultures and in dozens of languages.

Meta recognizes how important it is for Facebook to be a place where people feel empowered to communicate, and we take our role seriously in keeping abuse off the service. That’s why we developed standards for what is and isn’t allowed on Facebook.

These standards are based on feedback from people and the advice of experts in fields like technology, public safety and human rights. To ensure everyone’s voice is valued, we take great care to create standards that include different views and beliefs, especially from people and communities that might otherwise be overlooked or marginalized.

  

**Please note that the US English version of the Community Standards reflects the most up to date set of the policies and should be used as the primary document.**

### Our commitment to voice

The goal of our Community Standards is to create a place for expression and give people a voice. Meta wants people to be able to talk openly about the issues that matter to them, even if some may disagree or find them objectionable. In some cases, we allow content—which would otherwise go against our standards—if it’s [newsworthy](https://transparency.fb.com/features/approach-to-newsworthy-content/) and in the public interest. We do this only after weighing the public interest value against the risk of harm, and we look to international human rights standards to make these judgments.

Our commitment to expression is paramount, but we recognize the internet creates new and increased opportunities for abuse. For these reasons, when we limit expression, we do it in service of one or more of the following values:

AUTHENTICITY
------------

We want to make sure the content people see on Facebook is authentic. We believe that authenticity creates a better environment for sharing, and that’s why we don’t want people using Facebook to misrepresent who they are or what they’re doing.

SAFETY
------

We’re committed to making Facebook a safe place. We remove content that could contribute to a risk of harm to the physical security of persons. Content that threatens people has the potential to intimidate, exclude or silence others and isn’t allowed on Facebook.

PRIVACY
-------

We’re committed to protecting personal privacy and information. Privacy gives people the freedom to be themselves, choose how and when to share on Facebook and connect more easily.

DIGNITY
-------

We believe that all people are equal in dignity and rights. We expect that people will respect the dignity of others and not harass or degrade others.

### Community Standards

Our Community Standards apply to everyone, all around the world, and to all types of content.

Each section of our Community Standards starts with a “Policy Rationale” that sets out the aims of the policy followed by specific policy lines that outline:

Content that's not allowed; and

Content that requires additional information or context to enforce on, content that is allowed with a warning screen or content that is allowed but can only be viewed by adults aged 18 and older.

Violence and Incitement
=======================

#### Policy Rationale

We aim to prevent potential offline harm that may be related to content on Facebook. While we understand that people commonly express disdain or disagreement by threatening or calling for violence in non-serious ways, we remove language that incites or facilitates serious violence. We remove content, disable accounts and work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm or direct threats to public safety. We also try to consider the language and context in order to distinguish casual statements from content that constitutes a credible threat to public or personal safety. In determining whether a threat is credible, we may also consider additional information like a person's public visibility and the risks to their physical safety.

In some cases, we see aspirational or conditional threats directed at terrorists and other violent actors (e.g. "Terrorists deserve to be killed"), and we deem those non-credible, absent specific evidence to the contrary.

#### Do not post:

Threats that could lead to death (and other forms of high-severity violence) and admission of past violence targeting people or places where threat is defined as any of the following:

* Statements of intent to commit high-severity violence. This includes content where a symbol represents the target and/or includes a visual of an armament or method to represent violence.
* Calls for high-severity violence including content where no target is specified but a symbol represents the target and/or includes a visual of an armament or method that represents violence.
* Statements advocating for high-severity violence.
* Aspirational or conditional statements to commit high-severity violence.
* Statements admitting to committing high-severity violence except when shared in a context of redemption, self-defense or when committed by law enforcement, military or state security personnel.

Content that asks, admits to offering or offers services for hire to kill others (for example, hitmen, mercenaries, assassins) or advocates for the use of a hitman, mercenary or assassin against a target

Admissions, statements of intent or advocacy, calls to action, or aspirational or conditional statements to kidnap or abduct a target or that promotes, supports or advocates for kidnapping or abduction

Content that depicts kidnappings or abductions if it is clear the content is not being shared by a victim or their family as a plea for help, or shared for informational, condemnation or awareness raising purposes

Threats of high-severity violence using digitally-produced or altered imagery to target living people with armaments, methods of violence or dismemberment

Threats that lead to serious injury (mid-severity violence) and admission of past violence toward private individuals, unnamed specified persons, minor public figures, high-risk persons or high-risk groups where threat is defined as any of the following:

* Statements of intent to commit violence, or
* Statements advocating violence, or
* Calls for mid-severity violence including content where no target is specified but a symbol represents the target, or
* Aspirational or conditional statements to commit violence, or
* Statements admitting to committing mid-severity violence except when shared in a context of redemption, self-defense, fight-sports context or when committed by law enforcement, military or state security personnel.

Content about other target(s) apart from private individuals, minor public figures, high-risk persons or high-risk groups and any credible:

* Statements of intent to commit violence, or
* Calls for action of violence, or
* Statements advocating for violence, or
* Aspirational or conditional statements to commit violence

Threats that lead to physical harm (or other forms of lower-severity violence) towards private individuals (self-reporting required) or minor public figures where threat is defined as any of the following:

* Private individuals (name and/or face match are required) or minor public figures that includes:
    * Statements of intent, calls for action, advocating, aspirational or conditional statements to commit low-severity violence

Instructions on how to make or use weapons if there is evidence of a goal to seriously injure or kill people through:

* Language explicitly stating that goal, or
* Photos or videos that show or simulate the end result (serious injury or death) as part of the instruction.
* Unless the aforementioned content is shared as part of recreational self defense, for military training purposes, commercial video games, or news coverage (posted by a Page or with a news logo).

Providing instructions on how to make or use explosives, unless there is clear context that the content is for a non-violent purpose (for example, part of commercial video games, clear scientific/educational purpose, fireworks or specifically for fishing)

Any content containing statements of intent, calls for action, conditional or aspirational statements, or advocating for violence due to voting, voter registration or the administration or outcome of an election

Statements of intent or advocacy, calls to action, or aspirational or conditional statements to bring or take up armaments to locations (including but not limited to places of worship, educational facilities, polling places or locations used to count votes or administer an election) or locations where there are temporary signals of a heightened risk of violence or offline harm. This may be the case, for example, when there is a known protest and counter-protest planned or violence broke out at a protest in the same city within the last 7 days. This includes a visual of an armament or method that represents violence that targets these locations.

Statements of intent or advocacy, calls to action, or aspirational or conditional statements to forcibly enter locations (including but not limited to places of worship, educational facilities, polling places or locations used to count votes or administer an election) where there are temporary signals of a heightened risk of violence or offline harm. This may be the case, for example, when there is a known protest and counter-protest planned or violence broke out at a protest in the same city within the last 7 days.

#### For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or context to enforce:

Do not post:

* Violent threats against law enforcement officers.
* Violent threats against people accused of a crime. We remove this content when we have reason to believe that the content is intended to cause physical harm.

* Coded statements where the method of violence or harm is not clearly articulated, but the threat is veiled or implicit. Meta looks at the below signals to determine whether there is a threat of harm in the content.

* Shared in a retaliatory context (e.g., expressions of desire to do something harmful to others in response to a grievance or threat that may be real, perceived or anticipated)
* References to historical or fictional incidents of violence (e.g., content that threatens others by referring to known historical incidents of violence that have been executed throughout history or in fictional settings)
* Acts as a threatening call-to-action (e.g. content inviting or encouraging others to carry out harmful acts or to join in carrying out the harmful acts)
* Indicates knowledge of or shares sensitive information that could expose others to harm (e.g. content that either makes note of or implies awareness of personal information that might make a threat of physical violence more credible. This includes implying knowledge of a person's residential address, their place of employment or education, daily commute routes or current location)
* Local context or subject matter expertise confirms that the statement in question could be threatening and/or could lead to imminent violence or physical harm.
* The subject of the threat reports the content to us.

* Threats against election workers, including claims of election-related wrongdoing against private individuals when combined with a signal of violence or additional context that confirms that the claim could lead to imminent violence or physical harm.
* Implicit statements of intent or advocacy, calls to action, or aspirational or conditional statements to bring armaments to locations, including but not limited to places of worship, educational facilities, polling places, or locations used to count votes or administer an election (or encouraging others to do the same). We may also restrict calls to bring armaments to certain locations where there are temporarily signals of a heightened risk of violence or offline harm. This may be the case, for example, when there is a known protest and counter-protest planned or violence broke out at a protest in the same city within the last 7 days

Dangerous Individuals and Organizations
=======================================

#### Policy Rationale

In an effort to prevent and disrupt real-world harm, we do not allow organizations or individuals that proclaim a violent mission or are engaged in violence to have a presence on Facebook. We assess these entities based on their behavior both online and offline, most significantly, their ties to violence. Under this policy, we designate individuals, organizations, and networks of people. These designations are divided into three tiers that indicate the level of content enforcement, with Tier 1 resulting in the most extensive enforcement because we believe these entities have the most direct ties to offline harm.

**Tier 1** focuses on entities that engage in serious offline harms - including organizing or advocating for violence against civilians, repeatedly dehumanizing or advocating for harm against people based on protected characteristics, or engaging in systematic criminal operations. Tier 1 entities include terrorist, hate, and criminal organizations. We remove praise, substantive support, and representation of Tier 1 entities as well as their leaders, founders, or prominent members. Tier 1 includes hate organizations; criminal organizations, including those designated by the United States government as Specially Designated Narcotics Trafficking Kingpins (SDNTKs); and terrorist organizations, including entities and individuals designated by the United States government as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) or Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs). We remove praise, substantive support, and representation of Tier 1 entities as well as their leaders, founders, or prominent members.

In addition, we do not allow content that praises, substantively supports, or represents events that Facebook designates as violating violent events - including terrorist attacks, hate events, multiple-victim violence or attempted multiple-victim violence, multiple murders, or hate crimes. Nor do we allow praise, substantive support, or representation of the perpetrator(s) of such attacks. We also remove content that praises, substantively supports or represents ideologies that promote hate, such as nazism and white supremacy.

**Tier 2** focuses on entities that engage in violence against state or military actors but do not generally target civilians -- what we call “Violent Non-State Actors.” We remove all substantive support and representation of these entities, their leaders, and their prominent members. We remove any praise of these groups’ violent activities.

**Tier 3** focuses on entities that may repeatedly engage in violations of our Hate Speech or Dangerous Organizations policies on-or-off the platform or demonstrate strong intent to engage in offline violence in the near future, but have not necessarily engaged in violence to date or advocated for violence against others based on their protected characteristics. This includes Militarized Social Movements, Violence-Inducing Conspiracy Networks, and individuals and groups banned for promoting hatred. Tier 3 entities may not have a presence or coordinate on our platforms.

We recognize that users may share content that includes references to designated dangerous organizations and individuals to report on, condemn, or neutrally discuss them or their activities. Our policies are designed to allow room for these types of discussions while simultaneously limiting risks of potential offline harm. We thus require people to clearly indicate their intent when creating or sharing such content. If a user's intention is ambiguous or unclear, we default to removing content.

In line with international human rights law, our policies allow discussions about the human rights of designated individuals or members of designated dangerous entities, unless the content includes other praise, substantive support, or representation of designated entities or other policy violations, such as incitement to violence.

Please see our [Corporate Human Rights Policy](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Facebooks-Corporate-Human-Rights-Policy.pdf) for more information about our commitment to internationally recognized human rights.

#### We Remove:

We remove Praise, Substantive Support, and Representation of various Dangerous Organizations. These concepts apply to the organizations themselves, their activities, and their members. These concepts do not proscribe peaceful advocacy for particular political outcomes.

**Praise**, defined as any of the below:

* Speak positively about a designated entity or event;
    * E.g., “The fighters for the Islamic State are really brave!”
* Give a designated entity or event a sense of achievement;
    * E.g., “Timothy McVeigh is a martyr.”
* Legitimizing the cause of a designated entity by making claims that their hateful, violent, or criminal conduct is legally, morally, or otherwise justified or acceptable;
    * E.g., “Hitler did nothing wrong.”
* Aligning oneself ideologically with a designated entity or event.
    * E.g., “I stand with Brenton Tarrant.”

We remove Praise of Tier 1 entities and designated events. We will also remove praise of violence carried out by Tier 2 entities.

**Substantive Support**, defined as any of the below:

* Any act which improves the financial status of a designated entity - including funnelling money towards, or away from a designated entity;
    * E.g., “Donate to the KKK!”
* Any act which provides material aid to a designated entity or event;
    * E.g., “If you want to send care packages to the Sinaloa Cartel, use this address:”
* Putting out a call to action on behalf of a designated entity or event;
    * E.g., “Contact the Atomwaffen Division - (XXX) XXX-XXXX”
* Recruiting on behalf of a designated entity or event;
    * E.g., “If you want to fight for the Caliphate, DM me”
* Channeling information or resources, including official communications, on behalf of a designated entity or event
    * E.g., Directly quoting a designated entity without caption that condemns, neutrally discusses, or is a part of news reporting.

We remove Substantive Support of Tier 1 and Tier 2 entities and designated events.

**Representation**, defined as any of the below:

* Stating that you are a member of a designated entity, or are a designated entity;
    * E.g., “I am a grand dragon of the KKK.”
* Creating a Page, Profile, Event, Group, or other Facebook entity that is or purports to be owned by a Designated Entity or run on their behalf, or is or purports to be a designated event.
    * E.g., A Page named “American Nazi Party.”

We remove Representation of Tier 1 and 2 Designated Organizations, Hate-Banned Entities, and designated events.

#### Types and Tiers of Dangerous Organizations

**_Tier 1: Terrorism, organized hate, large-scale criminal activity, attempted multiple-victim violence, multiple victim violence, multiple murders, and violating violent events_**

We do not allow individuals or organizations involved in organized crime, including those designated by the United States government as specially designated narcotics trafficking kingpins (SDNTKs); hate; or terrorism, including entities designated by the United States government as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) or Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs), to have a presence onthe platform. We also don't allow other people to represent these entities. We do not allow leaders or prominent members of these organizations to have a presence on the platform, symbols that represent them to be used on the platform, or content that praises them or their acts. In addition, we remove any coordination of substantive support for these individuals and organizations.

We do not allow content that praises, substantively supports, or represents events that Meta designates as terrorist attacks, hate events, multiple-victim violence or attempted multiple-victim violence, serial murders, hate crimes or violating violent events.

We also do not allow Praise, Substantive Support, or Representation of designated hateful ideologies.

**Terrorist organizations and individuals**, defined as a non-state actor that:

**Multiple-Victim Violence and Multiple Murders**

* We consider an event to be multiple-victim violence or attempted multiple-victim violence if it results in three or more casualties in one incident, defined as deaths or serious injuries. Any Individual who has committed such an attack is considered to be a perpetrator or an attempted perpetrator of multiple-victim violence.
* We consider any individual who has committed two or more murders over multiple incidents or locations a multiple murderer.

**Hateful Ideologies**

* While our designations of organizations and individuals focus on behavior, we also recognize that there are certain ideologies and beliefs that are inherently tied to violence and attempts to organize people around calls for violence or exclusion of others based on their protected characteristics. In these cases, we designate the ideology itself and remove content that supports this ideology from our platform. These ideologies include:
    * Nazism
    * White Supremacy
    * White Nationalism
    * White Separatism
* We remove explicit Praise, Substantive Support, and Representation of these ideologies, and remove individuals and organizations that ascribe to one or more of these hateful ideologies.

**_Tier 2: Violent Non-State Actors_**

Organizations and individuals designated by Meta as Violent Non-state Actors are not allowed to have a presence on Facebook, or have a presence maintained by others on their behalf. As these communities are actively engaged in violence, substantive support of these entities is similarly not allowed. We will also remove praise of violence carried out by these entities.

**Violent Non-State Actors**, defined as any non-state actor that:

* engages in purposive and planned acts of violence primarily against a government military or other armed communities; and

Suicide and Self Injury
=======================

#### Policy Rationale

We care deeply about the safety of the people who use our apps. We regularly consult with experts in suicide and self-injury to help inform our policies and enforcement, and work with organizations around the world to provide assistance to people in distress.

While we do not allow people to intentionally or unintentionally celebrate or promote suicide or self-injury, we do allow people to discuss these topics because we want Facebook to be a space where people can share their experiences, raise awareness about these issues, and seek support from one another.

We define self-injury as the intentional and direct injuring of the body, including self-mutilation and eating disorders. We remove any content that encourages suicide or self-injury, including fictional content such as memes or illustrations and any self-injury content which is graphic, regardless of context. We also remove content that identifies and negatively targets victims or survivors of suicide or self-injury seriously, humorously or rhetorically, as well as real time depictions of suicide or self-injury. Content about recovery of suicide or self-harm that is allowed, but may contain imagery that could be upsetting, such as a healed scar, is placed behind a sensitivity screen.

When people post or search for suicide or self-injury- related content, we will direct them to local organizations that can provide support and if our Community Operations team is concerned about immediate harm we will contact local emergency services to get them help. For more information, visit the [Facebook Safety Center.](https://www.facebook.com/safety/wellbeing/suicideprevention)

With respect to live content, experts have told us that if someone is saying they intend to attempt suicide on a livestream, we should leave the content up for as long as possible, because the longer someone is talking to a camera, the more opportunity there is for a friend or family member to call emergency services.

However, to minimize the risk of others being negatively impacted by viewing this content, we will stop the livestream at the point at which the threat turns into an attempt. As mentioned above, in any case, we will contact emergency services if we identify someone is at immediate risk of harming themselves.

#### Do not post:

Content that promotes, encourages, coordinates, or provides instructions for

* Suicide.
* Self-injury.
* Eating disorders.

Content that depicts graphic self-injury imagery

It is against our policies to post content depicting a person who engaged in a suicide attempt or death by suicide

Content that focuses on depiction of ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave stomach, or protruding spine or scapula when shared together with terms associated with eating disorders

Content that contains instructions for drastic and unhealthy weight loss when shared together with terms associated with eating disorders.

Content that mocks victims or survivors of suicide, self-injury or eating disorders who are either publicly known or implied to have experienced suicide or self-injury

#### For the following content, we restrict content to adults over the age of 18, and include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware the content may be upsetting:

* Photos or videos depicting a person who engaged in euthanasia/assisted suicide in a medical setting.

#### For the following content, we include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware the content may be upsetting to some:

* Content that depicts older instances of self-harm such as healed cuts or other non-graphic self-injury imagery in a self-injury, suicide or recovery context.

#### We provide resources to people who post written or verbal admissions of engagement in self injury, including:

* Euthanasia/assisted suicide.
* Self-harm.
* Eating disorders.
* Vague, potentially suicidal statements or references (including memes or stock imagery about sad mood or depression) in a suicide or self-injury context.

We try to identify suicide notes using several factors, including but not limited to, family or legal representative requests, media reports, law enforcement reports or other third party sources (e.g. government agencies, NGOs).
    * A suicide note may also be removed when reported through the [Suicidal Content Contact Form](https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/305410456169423/) or [Instagram Contact Form](https://help.instagram.com/contact/383679321740945/) when we have confirmation of a suicide or suicide attempt

Child Sexual Exploitation, Abuse and Nudity
===========================================

#### Policy Rationale

We do not allow content or activity that sexually exploits or endangers children. When we become aware of apparent child exploitation, we report it to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), in compliance with applicable law. We know that sometimes people share nude images of their own children with good intentions; however, we generally remove these images because of the potential for abuse by others and to help avoid the possibility of other people reusing or misappropriating the images.

We also work with external experts, including the [Facebook Safety Advisory Board](https://www.facebook.com/help/222332597793306?ref=ccs), to discuss and improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, especially with regard to children. Learn more about the [technology we’re using to fight against child exploitation](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/10/fighting-child-exploitation/).

Adult Sexual Exploitation
=========================

#### Policy Rationale

We recognize the importance of Facebook as a place to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and exploitation. In an effort to create space for this conversation and promote a safe environment, we allow victims to share their experiences, but remove content that depicts, threatens or promotes sexual violence, sexual assault, or sexual exploitation. We also remove content that displays, advocates for or coordinates sexual acts with non-consenting parties to avoid facilitating non-consensual sexual acts.

To protect victims and survivors, we remove images that depict incidents of sexual violence and intimate images shared without the consent of the person(s) pictured. As noted in the introduction, we also work with external safety experts to discuss and improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, and we may remove content when they provide information that content is linked to harmful activity. We have written about the [technology we use to protect against intimate images](https://about.fb.com/news/2019/03/detecting-non-consensual-intimate-images/) and the [research that has informed our work](https://about.fb.com/news/2019/03/protecting-intimate-images/). We’ve also put together a [guide to reporting and removing intimate images shared without your consent](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/not-without-my-consent.pdf).

#### Do not post:

In instances where content consists of any form of non-consensual sexual touching, necrophilia, or forced stripping, including:

* Depictions (including real photos/videos except in a real-world art context), or
* Sharing, offering, asking for or threatening to share imagery, or
* Descriptions, unless shared by or in support of the victim/survivor, or
* Advocacy (including aspirational and conditional statements), or
* Statements of intent, or
* Calls for action, or
* Admitting participation, or
* Mocking victims of any of the above.
* We will also take down content shared by a third party that identifies victims or survivors of sexual assault when reported by the victim or survivor.

Content that attempts to exploit people by any of the following:

* Sextortion: Coercing money, favors or intimate imagery from people with threats to expose their intimate imagery or intimate information
* Sharing, threatening, stating an intent to share, offering or asking for non-consensual intimate imagery that fulfills all of the 3 following conditions:
    * Imagery is non-commercial or produced in a private setting.
    * Person in the imagery is (near) nude, engaged in sexual activity or in a sexual pose.
    * Lack of consent to share the imagery is indicated by meeting any of the signals:
        * Vengeful context (such as, caption, comments or page title).
        * Independent sources (such as, law enforcement record) including entertainment media (such as, leak of images confirmed by media).
        * A visible match between the person depicted in the image and the person who has reported the content to us.
        * The person who reported the content to us shares the same name as the person depicted in the image.
* Secretly taken non-commercial imagery of a real person's commonly sexualized body parts (breasts, groin, buttocks, or thighs) or of a real person engaged in sexual activity.

#### For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the content may be disturbing:

Narratives and statements that contain a description of non-consensual sexual touching (written or verbal) that includes details beyond mere naming or mentioning the act if:

* Shared by the victim, or
* Shared by a third party (other than the victim) in support of the victim or condemnation of the act or for general awareness to be determined by context/caption.

Content mocking the concept of non-consensual sexual touching

#### For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or context to enforce:

We may restrict visibility to people over the age of 18 and include a warning label on certain fictional videos (e.g., digital and hand-drawn imagery, film and TV show scenes, comic books, music videos) that depict non-consensual sexual touching.

We may also enforce on content shared by a third party that identifies survivors of sexual assault when reported by an authorized representative or Trusted Partner.

Bullying and Harassment
=======================

#### Policy Rationale

Bullying and harassment happen in many places and come in many different forms from making threats and releasing personally identifiable information to sending threatening messages and making unwanted malicious contact. We do not tolerate this kind of behavior because it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on Facebook.

We distinguish between public figures and private individuals because we want to allow discussion, which often includes critical commentary of people who are featured in the news or who have a large public audience. For public figures, we remove attacks that are severe as well as certain attacks where the public figure is directly tagged in the post or comment.

For private individuals, our protection goes further: We remove content that's meant to degrade or shame, including, for example, claims about someone's sexual personal activity. We recognize that bullying and harassment can have more of an emotional impact on minors, which is why our policies provide heightened protection for users between the ages of 13 and 18.

Context and intent matter, and we allow people to post and share if it is clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to bullying and harassment. In certain instances, we require self-reporting because it helps us understand that the person targeted feels bullied or harassed. In addition to reporting such behavior and content, we encourage people to use [tools available on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/safety/tools) to help protect against it.

We also have a [Bullying Prevention Hub](https://www.facebook.com/safety/bullying), which is a resource for teens, parents, and educators seeking support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers step-by-step guidance, including information on how to start important conversations about bullying. Learn more about what we are doing to protect people from bullying and harassment [here](https://about.fb.com/news/2018/10/protecting-people-from-bullying/).

Note: This policy does not apply to individuals who are part of designated organizations under the [Dangerous Organizations and Individuals policy](https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/dangerous-individuals-organizations/) or individuals who died prior to 1900.

Human Exploitation
==================

#### Policy Rationale

In an effort to disrupt and prevent harm, we remove content that facilitates or coordinates the exploitation of humans, including human trafficking. We define human trafficking as the business of depriving someone of liberty for profit. It is the exploitation of humans in order to force them to engagein commercial sex, labor or other activities against their will. It relies on deception, force and coercion, and degrades humans by depriving them of their freedom while economically or materially benefiting others.

Human trafficking is multi-faceted and global; it can affect anyone regardless of age, socioeconomic background, ethnicity, gender or location. It takes many forms, and any given trafficking situation can involve various stages of development. By the coercive nature of this abuse, victims cannot consent.

While we need to be careful not to conflate human trafficking and smuggling, they can be related and exhibit overlap. The United Nations defines human smuggling as the procurement or facilitation of illegal entry into a state across international borders. Without necessity for coercion or force, it may still result in the exploitation of vulnerable individuals who are trying to leave their country of origin, often in pursuit of a better life. Human smuggling is a crime against a state, relying on movement, and human trafficking is a crime against a person, relying on exploitation.

In addition to content condemning or raising awareness about human trafficking or smuggling issues, we allow content asking for or sharing information about personal safety and border crossing, seeking asylum or how to leave a country.

#### Do not post:

Content that recruits people for, facilitates or exploits people through any of the following forms of human trafficking:

* Sex trafficking
* Sales of children or illegal adoption.
* Orphanage trafficking and orphanage volun-tourism.
* Forced marriages.
* Labor exploitation (including bonded labor).
* Domestic servitude.
* Non-regenerative organ trafficking, not including organ removal, donation, or transplant in a non-exploitative organ donation context.
* Forced criminal activity (e.g. forced begging, forced drug trafficking).
* Recruitment of child soldiers.

Content that offers to provide or facilitate human smuggling

Content that asks for human smuggling services

Privacy Violations
==================

#### Policy Rationale

Privacy and the protection of personal information are fundamentally important values for Facebook. We work hard to safeguard your personal identity and information and we do not allow people to post personal or confidential information about yourself or of others.

We remove content that shares, offers or solicits personally identifiable information or other private information that could lead to physical or financial harm, including financial, residential, and medical information, as well as private information obtained from illegal sources. We also recognize that private information may become publicly available through news coverage, court filings, press releases, or other sources. When that happens, we may allow the information to be posted.

We also provide people ways to report imagery that they believe to be in violation of their privacy rights.

Hate Speech
===========

#### Policy Rationale

We believe that people use their voice and connect more freely when they don’t feel attacked on the basis of who they are. That is why we don’t allow hate speech on Facebook. It creates an environment of intimidation and exclusion, and in some cases may promote offline violence.

We define hate speech as a direct attack against people — rather than concepts or institutions— on the basis of what we call protected characteristics: race, ethnicity, national origin, disability, religious affiliation, caste, sexual orientation, sex, gender identity and serious disease. We define attacks as violent or dehumanizing speech, harmful stereotypes, statements of inferiority, expressions of contempt, disgust or dismissal, cursing and calls for exclusion or segregation. We also prohibit the use of harmful stereotypes, which we define as dehumanizing comparisons that have historically been used to attack, intimidate, or exclude specific groups, and that are often linked with offline violence. We consider age a protected characteristic when referenced along with another protected characteristic. We also protect refugees, migrants, immigrants and asylum seekers from the most severe attacks, though we do allow commentary and criticism of immigration policies. Similarly, we provide some protections for characteristics like occupation, when they’re referenced along with a protected characteristic. Sometimes, based on local nuance, we consider certain words or phrases as frequently used proxies for PC groups.

We also prohibit the usage of slurs that are used to attack people on the basis of their protected characteristics. However, we recognize that people sometimes share content that includes slurs or someone else's hate speech to condemn it or raise awareness. In other cases, speech, including slurs, that might otherwise violate our standards can be used self-referentially or in an empowering way. Our policies are designed to allow room for these types of speech, but we require people to clearly indicate their intent. If the intention is unclear, we may remove content.

Facebook looks at a range of signs to determine whether there is a threat of harm in the content. These include but are not limited to: content that could incite imminent violence or intimidation; whether there is a period of heightened tension such as an election or ongoing conflict; and whether there is a recent history of violence against the targeted protected group.

Violent and Graphic Content
===========================

#### Policy Rationale

To protect users from disturbing imagery, we remove content that is particularly violent or graphic, such as videos depicting dismemberment, visible innards or charred bodies. We also remove content that contains sadistic remarks towards imagery depicting the suffering of humans and animals.

In the context of discussions about important issues such as human rights abuses, armed conflicts or acts of terrorism, we allow graphic content (with some limitations) to help people to condemn and raise awareness about these situations.

We know that people have different sensitivities with regard to graphic and violent imagery. For that reason, we add a warning label to some graphic or violent imagery so that people are aware it may be sensitive before they click through. We also restrict the ability for users under 18 to view such content.

#### Do not post:

**Imagery of people**

Videos of people or dead bodies in non-medical settings if they depict

* Dismemberment.

    * Explicit sadistic remarks towards the suffering of animals depicted in the imagery.
* Offering or soliciting imagery that is deleted or put behind a warning screen under this policy, when accompanied by sadistic remarks.

#### For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the content may be disturbing. We also limit the ability to view the content to adults, ages 18 and older:

**Imagery of people**

Videos of people or dead bodies in a medical setting if they depict:

* Dismemberment.
* Visible internal organs; partially decomposed bodies.

* Victims of cannibalism.
* Throat-slitting.

Adult Nudity and Sexual Activity
================================

#### Policy Rationale

We restrict the display of nudity or sexual activity because some people in our community may be sensitive to this type of content. Additionally, we default to removing sexual imagery to prevent the sharing of non-consensual or underage content. Restrictions on the display of sexual activity also apply to digitally created content unless it is posted for educational, humorous, or satirical purposes.

Our nudity policies have become more nuanced over time. We understand that nudity can be shared for a variety of reasons, including as a form of protest, to raise awareness about a cause, or for educational or medical reasons.

Where such intent is clear, we make allowances for the content. For example, while we restrict some images of female breasts that include the nipple, we allow other images, including those depicting acts of protest, women actively engaged in breast-feeding and photos of post-mastectomy scarring. For images depicting visible genitalia or the anus in the context of birth and after-birth moments or health-related situations we include a warning label so that people are aware that the content may be sensitive. We also allow photographs of paintings, sculptures, and other art that depicts nude figures.

#### Do not post:

* Imagery of real nude adults, if it depicts:
    * Visible genitalia except in the context of birth giving and after-birth moments or if there is medical or health context situations (for example, gender confirmation surgery, examination for cancer or disease prevention/assessment).
    * Visible anus and/or fully nude close-ups of buttocks unless photoshopped on a public figure.
    * Uncovered female nipples except in the context of breastfeeding, birth giving and after-birth moments, medical or health context (for example, post-mastectomy, breast cancer awareness or gender confirmation surgery) or an act of protest.
* Imagery of sexual activity, including:
    * Explicit sexual activity and stimulation
        * Explicit sexual intercourse or oral sex, defined as mouth or genitals entering or in contact with another person's genitals or anus, where at least one person's genitals are nude.
        * Explicit stimulation of genitalia or anus, defined as stimulating genitalia or anus or inserting objects, including sex toys, into genitalia or anus, where the contact with the genitalia or anus is directly visible.
    * Implied sexual activity and stimulation, except in cases of medical or health context, advertisements, and recognized fictional images or with indicators of fiction:
        * Implied sexual intercourse or oral sex, defined as mouth or genitals entering or in contact with another person's genitals or anus, when the genitalia and/or the activity or contact is not directly visible.
        * Implied stimulation of genitalia or anus, defined as stimulating genitalia or anus or inserting objects, including sex toys, into or above genitalia or anus, when the genitalia and/or the activity or contact is not directly visible.
    * Other activities, except in cases of medical or health context, advertisements, and recognized fictional images or with indicators of fiction, including but not limited to:
        * Erections
        * Presence of by-products of sexual activity.
        * Sex toys placed upon or inserted into mouth.
        * Stimulation of naked human nipples.

        * Dismemberment.
        * Cannibalism.

    * Adult sexual activity in digital art, except when posted in an educational or scientific context, or when it meets one of the criteria below and shown only to individuals 18 years and older.
* Extended audio of sexual activity

#### For the following content, we include a label so that people are aware the content may be sensitive:

Imagery of visible adult male and female genitalia, fully nude close-ups of buttocks or anus, or implied/other sexual activity, when shared in medical or health context which can include, for example:

* Birth-giving and after-birth giving moments, including both natural vaginal delivery and caesarean section
* Gender confirmation surgery
* Genitalia self-examination for cancer or disease prevention/assessment

#### We only show this content to individuals 18 and older:

* Real world art that depicts implied or explicit sexual activity.
* Imagery depicting bestiality in real-world art provided it is shared neutrally or in condemnation and the people or animals depicted are not real.

Sexual Solicitation
===================

#### Policy Rationale

As noted in Section 8 of our Community Standards ([Adult Sexual Exploitation](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/sexual_exploitation_adults)), people use Facebook to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and exploitation. We recognize the importance of and allow for this discussion.We also allow for the discussion of sex worker rights advocacy and sex work regulation. We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or coordinates sexual encounters or commercial sexual services between adults. We do this to avoid facilitating transactions that may involve trafficking, coercion and non-consensual sexual acts.

We also restrict sexually-explicit language that may lead to sexual solicitation because some audiences within our global community may be sensitive to this type of content, and it may impede the ability for people to connect with their friends and the broader community.

#### Do not post:

Content that offers or asks for adult commercial services, such as requesting, offering or asking for rates for escort service and paid sexual fetish or domination services. (Content that recruits or offers other people for third-party commercial sex work is separately considered under [the Human Exploitation policy).](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/human_exploitation)

Attempted coordination of or recruitment for, adult sexual activities, except when promoting an event or venue, including but not limited to:

* Filmed sexual activities.
* Pornographic activities, strip club shows, live sex performances or erotic dances.
* Sexual, erotic or tantric massages.

Explicit sexual solicitation by, including but not limited to the following, offering or asking for:

* Offering or asking for sex or sexual partners (including partners who share fetish or sexual interests).
* Sex chat or conversations.
* Nude photos/videos/imagery/sexual fetish items.
* Sexual slang terms.

We allow expressing desire for sexual activity, promoting sex education, discussing sexual practices or experiences, or offering classes or programs that teach techniques or discuss sex.

Content that is implicitly or indirectly offering or asking for sexual solicitation and meets both of the following criteria. If both criteria are not met, it is not deemed to be violating. For example, if content is a hand-drawn image depicting sexual activity but does not ask or offer sexual solicitation, it is not violating:

* **Criteria 1: Offer or ask**
    * Content that implicitly or indirectly (typically through providing a method of contact) offers or asks for sexual solicitation.
* **Criteria 2: Suggestive Elements**
    * Content that makes the aforementioned offer or ask using one or more of the following sexually suggestive elements:
        * Regional sexualized slang,
        * Mentions or depictions of sexual activity such as sexual roles, sex positions, fetish scenarios, state of arousal, act of sexual intercourse or activity (e.g. sexual penetration or self-pleasuring), commonly sexual emojis
        * Including content (hand drawn, digital or real-world art) that depicts sexual activity as defined in [Adult Nudity and Sexual Activity policy](https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/adult-nudity-sexual-activity/)
        * Poses,
        * Audio of sexual activity or other content that violates the [Adult Nudity and Sexual Activity policy](https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/adult-nudity-sexual-activity/)

An offer or ask for pornographic material (including, but not limited to, sharing of links to external pornographic websites)

Sexually-explicit language that goes into graphic detail beyond mere reference to:

* A state of sexual arousal (e.g wetness or erection) or
* An act of sexual intercourse (e.g sexual penetration, self-pleasuring or exercising fetish scenarios).
* Except for content shared in a humorous, satirical, or educational context, as a sexual metaphor or as sexual cursing.

#### For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or context to enforce:

* In certain cases, we will allow content that may otherwise violate the Community Standards when it is determined that the content is satirical. Content will only be allowed if the violating elements of the content are being satirized or attributed to something or someone else in order to mock or criticize them.

Account Integrity and Authentic Identity
========================================

#### Policy Rationale

Authenticity is the cornerstone of our community. We believe that authenticity helps create a community where people are accountable to each other, and to Facebook, in meaningful ways. We want to allow for the range of diverse ways that identity is expressed across our global community, while also preventing impersonation and identity misrepresentation. That is why we require people to connect on Facebook using the name they go by in everyday life. Our authenticity policies are intended to create a safe environment where people can trust and hold one another accountable.

In order to maintain a safe environment and empower free expression, we remove accounts that are harmful to the community, including those that compromise the security of other accounts and our services. We have built a combination of automated and manual systems to block and remove accounts that are used to persistently or egregiously abuse our Community Standards.

Because account level removal is a severe action, whenever possible, we aim to give our community a chance to learn our rules and follow our Community Standards. Penalties, including account disables, are designed to be proportionate to the severity of the violation and the risk of harm posed to the community. Continued violations, despite repeated warnings and restrictions, or violations that pose severe safety risks will lead to an account being disabled.

#### We do not allow the use of our services and will restrict or disable accounts or other entities (such as pages, groups, and events) if you:

* [Severely violate](https://transparency.fb.com/enforcement/taking-action/disabling-accounts/) our Community Standards.
* [Persistently violate](https://transparency.fb.com/enforcement/taking-action/disabling-accounts/) our Community Standards.
* Coordinate as part of a network of accounts or other entities in order to violate or evade our Community Standards.
* Represent [Dangerous Individuals or Organizations](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/dangerous_individuals_organizations).
* Create or use an account that demonstrates an intent to violate our Community Standards.
* Create or use an account by scripted or other inauthentic means.
* Create an account, Page, Group or Event to evade our enforcement actions, including creating an account to bypass a restriction or after we have disabled your previous account, Page, Group or Event.
* Create or use an account that deliberately misrepresents your identity in order to mislead or deceive others, or to evade enforcement or violate our other Community Standards. We consider a number of factors when assessing misleading identity misrepresentation, such as:
    * Repeated or significant changes to identity details, such as name or age
    * Misleading profile information, such as bio details and profile location
    * Using stock imagery or stolen photos
    * Other related account activity
* Impersonate others by:
    * Using their photos with the explicit aim to deceive others.
    * Creating an account assuming to be or speak for another person or entity.
    * Creating a Page assuming to be or speak for another person or entity for whom the user is not authorized to do so.
* Are under 13 years old.
* Are a convicted sex offender.
* Are prohibited from receiving our products, services or software under applicable laws.

#### In certain cases, such as those outlined below, we will seek further information about an account before taking actions ranging from temporarily restricting accounts to permanently disabling them.

* Accounts misrepresenting their identity (Facebook and Messenger only) by:
    * Using a name that is not the [authentic name](https://www.facebook.com/help/112146705538576?ref=ccs) you go by in everyday life
        * Using an inherently violating name, containing slurs or any other violations of the [Community Standards](https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/)
    * Providing a false date of birth.
    * Creating a single account that represents or is used by more than one person.
    * Maintaining multiple accounts as a single user.

Spam
====

#### Policy Rationale

We work hard to limit the spread of spam because we do not want to allow content that is designed to deceive, or that attempts to mislead users, to increase viewership. This content creates a negative user experience, detracts from people's ability to engage authentically in online communities and can threaten the security, stability and usability of our services. We also aim to prevent people from abusing our platform, products or features to artificially increase viewership or distribute content en masse for commercial gain.

#### Do not:

* Post, share, engage with content or create accounts, Groups, Pages, Events or other assets, either manually or automatically, at very high frequencies.
* Attempt to or successfully sell, buy or exchange site privileges, engagement, or product features, such as accounts, admin roles, permission to post, Pages, Groups, likes, etc., except in the case of clearly identified branded content, as defined by our [Branded Content Policies](https://www.facebook.com/policies/brandedcontent/).

* Require or claim that users are required to engage with content (e.g. liking, sharing) before they are able to view or interact with promised content.
* Encourage likes, shares, follows, clicks or the use of apps or websites under false pretenses, such as:
    * Offering false or non-existent services or functionality(e.g. “Get a ‘Dislike’ button!”)
    * Failing to direct to promised content (e.g. “Click here for a discount code at Nordstrom”; _false play buttons_)
    * The deceptive or misleading use of URLs, defined as:
        * **Cloaking**: Presenting different content to Facebook users and Facebook crawlers or tools.
        * **Misleading content**: Content contains a link that promises one type of content but delivers something substantially different.
        * **Deceptive redirect behavior**: Websites that require an action (e.g. captcha, watch ad, click here) in order to view the expected landing page content and the domain name of the URL changes after the required action is complete.
        * **Like/share-gating**: Landing pages that require users to like, share, or otherwise engage with content before gaining access to content.
        * **Deceptive landing page functionality**: Websites that have a misleading user interface, which results in accidental traffic being generated (e.g. pop-ups/unders, clickjacking, etc.).
        * **Typosquatting**: An external website pretends to be a reputable brand or service by using a name, domain or content that features typos, misspellings or other means to impersonate well-known brands using a landing page similar to another, trusted site to mislead visitors (e.g. www.faceb00k.com, www.face\_book.com).
        * And other behaviors that are substantially similar to the above.

Cybersecurity
=============

#### Policy Rationale

We recognize that the safety of our users includes the security of their personal information, accounts, profiles and other Facebook entities they may manage, as well as our products and services more broadly. Attempts to gather sensitive personal information or engage in unauthorized access by deceptive or invasive methods are harmful to the authentic, open and safe atmosphere that we want to foster. Therefore, we do not allow attempts to gather sensitive user information or engage in unauthorized access through the abuse of our platform, products, or services.

#### Do not:

Attempt to compromise user accounts, profiles, or other Facebook entities, abuse our products or services, gather sensitive information through deceptive means, or attempt to engage in unauthorized access, including:

* Gaining access to accounts, profiles Facebook, Inc. entities, or user data other than your own through deceptive means or without explicit permission from the account, profile, or entity owner.
* Encouraging or deceiving users to download or run files or programs that will compromise a user’s online or data security, including through malicious software or websites. Such files and programs will be deemed malicious software or "malware" if they harm or gain unauthorized access to a computer, device, or network.
* Attempting to obtain, acquire or request another user’s login credentials, personal information or other sensitive data - whether explicitly or through deceptive means such as phishing (e.g. fake surveys designed to capture log-in info or links to fake login pages or impostor websites) or the use of malicious software or websites.
* Publicly sharing your own or others’ login information, either on platform or through a third party service.
* Creating, sharing or hosting malicious software including browser extensions and mobile applications, on or off the platform that put our users or products and services at risk.
* Providing online infrastructure, including web hosting services, domain name system servers and ad networks that enables abusive links such that a majority of those links on Facebook or Instagram violate the spam or cybersecurity sections of the Community Standards.

Inauthentic Behavior
====================

#### Policy Rationale

In line with our commitment to authenticity, we do not allow people to misrepresent themselves on Facebook, use fake accounts, artificially boost the popularity of content or engage in behaviors designed to enable other violations under our Community Standards. This policy is intended to protect the security of user accounts and our services, and create a space where people can trust the people and communities they interact with.

#### Do not:

* Use multiple Facebook accounts or share accounts between multiple people
* Misuse Facebook or Instagram reporting systems to harass others
* Conceal a Page’s purpose by misleading users about the ownership or control of that Page
* Engage in or claim to engage in inauthentic behavior, which is defined as the use of Facebook or Instagram assets (accounts, Pages, Groups, or Events), to mislead people or Facebook:
    * About the identity, purpose, or origin of the entity that they represent.
    * About the popularity of Facebook or Instagram content or assets.
    * About the purpose of an audience or community.
    * About the source or origin of content.
    * To evade enforcement under our Community Standards.

For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or context to enforce:

* We do not allow entities to engage in, or claim to engage in Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior, defined as the use of multiple Facebook or Instagram assets, working in concert to engage in Inauthentic Behavior (as defined above), where the use of fake accounts is central to the operation
* We do not allow entities to engage in, or claim to engage in foreign or government interference, which is Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior conducted on behalf of a foreign or government actor.
* We do not allow governments that have instituted sustained blocks of social media to use their official departments, agencies, and embassies to deny the use of force or violent events in the context of an attack against the territorial integrity of another state in violation of Article 2(4) of the UN charter.

Misinformation
==============

#### Policy Rationale

Misinformation is different from other types of speech addressed in our Community Standards because there is no way to articulate a comprehensive list of what is prohibited. With graphic violence or hate speech, for instance, our policies specify the speech we prohibit, and even persons who disagree with those policies can follow them. With misinformation, however, we cannot provide such a line. The world is changing constantly, and what is true one minute may not be true the next minute. People also have different levels of information about the world around them, and may believe something is true when it is not. A policy that simply prohibits “misinformation” would not provide useful notice to the people who use our services and would be unenforceable, as we don’t have perfect access to information.

Instead, our policies articulate different categories of misinformation and try to provide clear guidance about how we treat that speech when we see it. For each category, our approach reflects our attempt to balance our values of expression, safety, dignity, authenticity, and privacy.

We remove misinformation where it is likely to directly contribute to the risk of imminent physical harm. We also remove content that is likely to directly contribute to interference with the functioning of political processes and certain highly deceptive manipulated media. In determining what constitutes misinformation in these categories, we partner with independent experts who possess knowledge and expertise to assess the truth of the content and whether it is likely to directly contribute to the risk of imminent harm. This includes, for instance, partnering with human rights organizations with a presence on the ground in a country to determine the truth of a rumor about civil conflict, and partnering with health organizations during the global COVID-19 pandemic.

For all other misinformation, we focus on reducing its prevalence or creating an environment that fosters a productive dialogue. We know that people often use misinformation in harmless ways, such as to exaggerate a point (“This team has the worst record in the history of the sport!”) or in humor or satire (“My husband just won Husband of the Year.”) They also may share their experience through stories that contain inaccuracies. In some cases, people share deeply-held personal opinions that others consider false or share information that they believe to be true but others consider incomplete or misleading.

Recognizing how common such speech is, we focus on slowing the spread of hoaxes and viral misinformation, and directing users to authoritative information. As part of that effort, we partner with third-party fact checking organizations to review and rate the accuracy of the most viral content on our platforms (see [here](https://transparency.fb.com/en-gb/features/how-fact-checking-works/) to learn more about how our fact-checking program works). We also provide [resources](https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/programs/third-party-fact-checking/industry-investments) to increase media and digital literacy so people can decide what to read, trust, and share themselves.

Finally, we prohibit content and behavior in other areas that often overlap with the spread of misinformation. For example, our Community Standards prohibit [fake accounts](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/misrepresentation), [fraud](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/fraud_deception), and [coordinated inauthentic behavior](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/inauthentic_behavior).

As online and offline environments change and evolve, we will continue to evolve these policies. Pages, Groups, Profiles, and Instagram accounts that repeatedly share the misinformation listed below may, in addition to having their content removed, receive decreased distribution, limitations on their ability to advertise, or be removed from our platforms. Additional information on what happens when Facebook removes content can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/help/260743102021762).

#### Misinformation we remove:

We remove the following types of misinformation:

**I. Physical Harm or Violence**

We remove misinformation or unverifiable rumors that expert partners have determined are likely to directly contribute to a risk of imminent violence or physical harm to people. We define misinformation as content with a claim that is determined to be false by an authoritative third party. We define an unverifiable rumor as a claim whose source expert partners confirm is extremely hard or impossible to trace, for which authoritative sources are absent, where there is not enough specificity for the claim to be debunked, or where the claim is too incredulous or too irrational to be believed.

We know that sometimes misinformation that might appear benign could, in a specific context, contribute to a risk of offline harm, including threats of violence that could contribute to a heightened risk of death, serious injury, or other physical harm. We work with a global network of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), not-for-profit organizations, humanitarian organizations, and international organizations that have expertise in these local dynamics.

**II. Harmful Health Misinformation**

We consult with leading health organizations to identify health misinformation likely to directly contribute to imminent harm to public health and safety. The harmful health misinformation that we remove includes the following:

* **Misinformation about vaccines.** We remove misinformation primarily about vaccines when public health authorities conclude that the information is false and likely to directly contribute to imminent vaccine refusals. They include:

* Vaccines cause autism (Ex: “Increased vaccinations are why so many kids have autism these days.”)
* Vaccines cause Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (Ex: “Don’t you know vaccines cause SIDS?”
* Vaccines cause the disease against which they are meant to protect, or cause the person receiving the vaccine to be more likely to get the disease (Ex: “Taking a vaccine actually makes you more likely to get the disease since there’s a strain of the disease inside. Beware!”)
* Vaccines or their ingredients are deadly, toxic, poisonous, harmful, or dangerous (Ex: “Sure, you can take vaccines, if you don’t mind putting poison in your body.”)
* Natural immunity is safer than vaccine-acquired immunity (Ex: “It’s safest to just get the disease rather than the vaccine.”)
* It is dangerous to get several vaccines in a short period of time, even if that timing is medically recommended (Ex: “Never take more than one vaccine at the same time, that is dangerous - I don’t care what your doctor tells you!”)
* Vaccines are not effective at preventing the disease against which they purport to protect. However, for the COVID-19, flu, and malaria vaccines, we do not remove claims that those vaccines are not effective in preventing someone from contracting those viruses. (Ex’s: Remove – “The polio vaccine doesn’t do anything to stop you from getting the disease”; Remove – “Vaccines actually don’t do anything to stop you from getting diseases”; Allow – “The vaccine doesn’t stop you from getting COVID-19, that’s why you still need to socially distance and wear a mask when you’re around others.”)
* Acquiring measles cannot cause death (requires additional information and/or context) (Ex: “Don’t worry about whether you get measles, it can’t be fatal.”)
* Vitamin C is as effective as vaccines in preventing diseases for which vaccines exist.

* **Misinformation about health during public health emergencies.** We remove misinformation during public health emergencies when public health authorities conclude that the information is false and likely to directly contribute to the risk of imminent physical harm, including by contributing to the risk of individuals getting or spreading a harmful disease or refusing an associated vaccine. We identify public health emergencies in partnership with global and local health authorities. This currently includes false claims related to COVID-19 that are verified by expert health authorities, about the existence or severity of the virus, how to cure or prevent it, how the virus is transmitted or who is immune, and false claims which discourage good health practices related to COVID-19 (such as getting tested, social distancing, wearing a face mask, and getting a vaccine for COVID-19). **Click [here](https://www.internmc.facebook.com/help/230764881494641) for a complete set of rules regarding what misinformation we do not allow regarding COVID-19 and vaccines.**

* **Promoting or advocating for harmful miracle cures for health issues.** These include treatments where the recommended application, in a health context, is likely to directly contribute to the risk of serious injury or death, and the treatment has no legitimate health use (ex: bleach, disinfectant, black salve, caustic soda).

**III. Voter or Census Interference**

In an effort to promote election and census integrity, we remove misinformation that is likely to directly contribute to a risk of interference with people’s ability to participate in those processes. This includes the following:

* Misinformation about the dates, locations, times, and methods for voting, voter registration, or census participation.
* Misinformation about who can vote, qualifications for voting, whether a vote will be counted, and what information or materials must be provided in order to vote.
* Misinformation about whether a candidate is running or not.
* Misinformation about who can participate in the census and what information or materials must be provided in order to participate.
* Misinformation about government involvement in the census, including, where applicable, that an individual's census information will be shared with another (non-census) government agency.
* Content falsely claiming that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is at a voting location.
* Explicit false claims that people will be infected by COVID-19 (or another communicable disease) if they participate in the voting process.

We have additional policies intended to cover calls for violence, the promotion of illegal participation, and calls for coordinated interference in elections, which are represented in other [sections](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/coordinating_harm_publicizing_crime) of our Community Standards.

**IV. Manipulated Media**

Media can be edited in a variety of ways. In many cases, these changes are benign, such as content being cropped or shortened for artistic reasons or music being added. In other cases, the manipulation is not apparent and could mislead, particularly in the case of video content. We remove this content because it can go viral quickly and experts advise that false beliefs regarding manipulated media often cannot be corrected through further discourse.

We remove videos under this policy if specific criteria are met: (1) the video has been edited or synthesized, beyond adjustments for clarity or quality, in ways that are not apparent to an average person, and would likely mislead an average person to believe a subject of the video said words that they did not say; and (2) the video is the product of artificial intelligence or machine learning, including deep learning techniques (e.g., a technical deepfake), that merges, combines, replaces, and/or superimposes content onto a video, creating a video that appears authentic.

Memorialization
===============

#### Policy Rationale

When someone passes away, Facebook friends and family can request that we [memorialize](https://www.facebook.com/help/150486848354038?ref=ccs) the Facebook account. Once memorialized, the word "Remembering" appears above the name on the person's profile so the account is now a memorial site and protects against attempted logins and fraudulent activity. To respect the choices someone made while alive, we aim to preserve their account after they pass away.

We have also made it possible for people to identify a [legacy contact](https://www.facebook.com/help/1568013990080948?ref=ccs) to look after their account after they pass away. To support the bereaved, in some instances we may remove or change certain content when the legacy contact or family members request it.

Visit [Hard Questions](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/08/what-should-happen-to-online-identity/) for more information about our memorialization policy and process. And see our [Newsroom](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/04/updates-to-memorialization/) for the latest tools we are building to support people during these difficult times.

#### For victims of murder and suicide we will remove the following content if it appears on the deceased’s profile photo, cover photo, or among recent timeline posts when requested by a legacy contact or family member of the deceased:

* Visual depiction of the object used in the deceased’s death.
* Imagery of the convicted or alleged murderer of the deceased.
* Content related to the deceased’s death.

For victims of murder, we will also remove the convicted or alleged murderer from the deceased’s profile if referenced in relationship status or among friends.

#### For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or context to enforce:

When brought to our attention by the legacy contact or a family member of the deceased, we will:

* Remove violating comments on a memorialized profile, which would typically require the individual to self report so that we know that they are unwanted.
* Remove praise or support for the death, disease, or harm of the deceased person on a memorialized profile.
* Change the deceased individual’s privacy settings from public to friends-only when there is harmful content on the profile.
* Change a violating account name on the profile of the deceased individual.

However, before sharing content on Facebook, please be sure you have the right to do so. We ask that you respect other people’s copyrights, trademarks and other legal rights. We are committed to helping people and organizations promote and protect their intellectual property rights.

Facebook’s [Terms of Service](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms) do not allow people to post content that violates someone else’s intellectual property rights, including copyright and trademark. We publish information about the intellectual property reports we receive in our bi-annual transparency report.

#### Upon receipt of a report from a rights holder or an authorized representative, we will remove or restrict content that engages in:

* Copyright infringement.
* Trademark infringement.

* Requests for removal of an underage account.
* Government requests for removal of child abuse imagery depicting, for example, beating by an adult or strangling or suffocating by an adult.
* Legal guardian requests for removal of attacks on unintentionally famous minors.

#### For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or context to enforce:

We may remove content created for the purpose of identifying a private minor if there may be a risk to the minor’s safety when requested by a user, government, law enforcement or external child safety experts.
