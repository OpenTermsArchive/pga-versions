2\. Meta advertising policy principles

Advertisers contribute to the Meta community in many ways, including highlighting new products and services or drawing attention to events and issues. To help keep both businesses and organizations who use our ad tools safe, and create a welcoming environment for everyone who uses our products and services, we have put in place our Advertising Standards to guide what is allowed across Meta technologies.

Advertisers running ads across Meta technologies must follow our and our Advertising Standards.

Our advertising policy principles

Our policies are guided by our company’s core and the following principles:

PROTECTING PEOPLE FROM UNSAFE AND DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES

Our policies require all advertisers to comply with the laws in their jurisdiction, not engage in discriminatory practices, and not sell illegal or unsafe substances.

PROTECTING PEOPLE FROM FRAUD OR SCAMS

Our policies prohibit ads promoting products, services, schemes or offers using deceptive or misleading practices, including those meant to scam people out of money or personal information.

PROMOTING POSITIVE USER EXPERIENCES

Because ads may be delivered to people in their Feed from Pages or accounts they don’t follow, we want to help ensure that the ads don’t detract from the overall experience across our technologies. For that reason, we prohibit ads containing shocking, sensational, or excessively violent content, certain adult content and profanity. We also prohibit other objectionable material, such as content implying or attempting to generate negative self-perception in order to promote diet, weight loss or other health related products.

PROMOTING TRANSPARENCY

We strive to make advertising more transparent and to give people more information about the ads they see. Our Ad Library offers a view of all ads currently running across our apps and services. It also offers additional information on ads about social issues, elections or politics, including range of spend, who saw the ad and the entities responsible for those ads. Ads about these topics are visible whether they're active or inactive and are stored in the Ad Library for 7 years. We also have an Info and Ads section on all Facebook Pages where people are able to click to see active ads a Page is running to help keep advertisers accountable.

Enforcement of our policies

We use automated and, in some instances, manual review to enforce our policies. Beyond reviewing individual ads, we also monitor and investigate advertiser behavior, and may restrict advertiser accounts that don't follow our Advertising Standards, Community Standards or other Meta policies and terms. Our review process may not detect all policy violations, and ads remain subject to review and re-review and may be rejected for violating our policies at any time. It is an advertiser’s responsibility to understand and comply with our policies outlined in Meta’s Advertising Standards, our Terms of Service and any other applicable terms and guidelines, in addition to all local laws, regulations and, where applicable, . Advertisers whose ads are rejected will typically be provided an opportunity to edit their ads in order to bring them into compliance and can request another review if they believe their ad was incorrectly rejected.

People can report ads if they believe they violate our policies. They can also see the details on why a certain ad appeared in their Feed, and they can control the ads they see in their Feed through our Ad Preferences tool.

3\. The ad review process

Our ad review system relies primarily on automated tools to check ads and business assets against our policies. Our ad review process starts automatically before ads begin running, and is typically completed within 24 hours, although it may take longer in some cases. During this review, the status of the ad will be “In review.” Additionally, ads may be reviewed again, including after they are live. You can find more information in our

What is reviewed

The ad review system reviews ads for violations of our policies. This review process may include the specific components of an ad, such as images, video, text and targeting information, as well as an ad’s associated landing page or other destinations, among other information.

Business asset review

We also review and take action on an advertiser’s Business Account or its assets (ad accounts, Pages and user accounts). As part of our review, we assess whether the account or its assets have violated our policies.

Outcome of review

If a violation is found at any point in the review process, the ad will be rejected, and the Business Account or its assets may be restricted. Lower quality ads which do not necessarily violate our policies may experience impacted performance. You can find more information about how quality may affect your ad in our

If a Business Account or its assets (ad account, Page or user account) is restricted, that account or asset can’t be used to advertise across our technologies. If a user account is restricted from advertising on a Business Account or ad account, other members of those accounts may still be able to advertise.

Re-review of ads

Ads remain subject to review and re-review at all times, and may be rejected or restricted for violation of our policies at any time. It is your responsibility to understand and comply with our policies.
