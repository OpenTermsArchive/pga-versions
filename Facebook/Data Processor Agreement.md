* You agree that Meta may subcontract its obligations under these Data Processing Terms to a sub-processor which might be based in the United States, the European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) or in other countries but only by way of a written agreement with the sub-processor which imposes obligations on the sub-processor no less onerous than as are imposed on Meta under these Data Processing Terms. Where the sub-processor fails to fulfill such obligations, Meta shall remain fully liable to you for the performance of that sub-processor’s obligations.
* To the extent GDPR applies to your Processing under these Data Processing Terms as Controller, you hereby authorise Meta to engage other Meta companies as its sub-processor(s) (a list of Meta sub-processor(s) is available [here](https://facebook.com/legal/ads-subprocessors)). Meta shall notify you of any additional sub-processor(s) in advance. If you reasonably object to such additional sub-processor(s), you may inform Meta in writing of the reasons for your objections.
