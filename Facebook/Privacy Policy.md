What Products does this Policy cover?
-------------------------------------

This Policy describes the information we, Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, process to provide [Meta Products](https://www.facebook.com/legal/meta-products?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A0.ex.0-WhatProductsDoesThis), which we also call "Products."

What information do we collect?
===============================

Highlights
----------

In this Policy we list the kinds of information we collect. Here are some important ones. We collect:

*   The information you give us when you sign up for our Products and create a profile, like your email address, phone number or age
*   What you do on our Products. This includes what you click on or like, your posts and photos, your chats with [AI at Meta](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/genai?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A1-WhatInformationDoWe), and messages you send. On some Products, you can use end-to-end encrypted messages. [Learn more.](https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/786613221989782/?helpref=uf_share&entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A1-WhatInformationDoWe)
*   Who your friends or followers are, and what they do on our Products

The information we collect and process about you depends on how you use our [Products\[3\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A1-WhatInformationDoWe#annotation-3). For example, we collect different information if you sell furniture on Marketplace than if you ask [AI at Meta](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/genai?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A1-WhatInformationDoWe) to write a joke for you. When you use our Products, we collect some information about you [even if you don't have an account\[4\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A1-WhatInformationDoWe#annotation-4).

What Products does this Policy cover?
-------------------------------------

This Policy describes the information we, Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, process to provide [Meta Products](https://www.facebook.com/legal/meta-products?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A0.ex.0-WhatProductsDoesThis), which we also call "Products."

Information we collect and receive if you use or interact with our Products but don’t have an account
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Even if you don't have an account, you may interact with or use [Meta Products\[3\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.41-InformationWeCollectIf#annotation-3). Then we collect things like:

*   Browser and app logs of your visits to public content, like Facebook Pages and videos
*   Basic information about [devices\[11\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.41-InformationWeCollectIf#annotation-11) that downloaded our apps, like device model and OS

We also receive information using cookies and similar technologies, like the Meta Pixel or Social Plugins, when you visit other websites and apps that use our [Business Tools](https://www.facebook.com/help/331509497253087/?helpref=uf_share&entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.41-InformationWeCollectIf) or other Meta Products.

Examples of why we collect and receive information
--------------------------------------------------

### Security of our Products

For example, we collect information to monitor attempted attacks on our systems, such as overloading our servers with traffic. Also, if we see someone without an account trying to load too many pages, they could be trying to [scrape](https://www.facebook.com/help/463983701520800/?helpref=search&entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.41-InformationWeCollectIf) our site in violation of our terms. Then we can take action to prevent it.

### Safety and integrity

We can take action according to our Community Standards against someone without an account interacting with Meta Products. For example, we can share information with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of death or imminent bodily harm.

### Performance

For example, we collect information when people use our Products, even if they don’t have an account, to measure how fast our pages load in different countries and whether they're working properly. This helps us identify and fix issues with local networks.

Information you provide
-----------------------

For example, when you create a Facebook account, you must provide some information, like a password and your email address or phone number, age and gender. You might choose to add other details to your account, like a profile photo or payment information.

We also collect information you provide when you:

*   Create your avatar
*   Fill out a form
*   Contact us

What we collect from our camera feature
---------------------------------------

José likes using Instagram’s Camera feature to take pictures of his flower garden. We collect information about how José uses the Camera feature. For example, if he chooses a background effect for the photo he’s about to take, we collect information from the camera so we can apply the effect to his photo.

How filters, effects, masks and avatars work
--------------------------------------------

If you use our camera or allow access to photos and videos, on certain Meta Products you can add filters, effects, masks or avatars. Some of these features process parts of faces or bodies within the camera frame, photo or video. Then they can do things like fit a mask correctly over the eyes, nose and mouth. The information we use for this process is used to create the feature. It’s not used to identify you.

What we collect from voice-enabled features
-------------------------------------------

Ren tells Meta’s voice-enabled Assistant to take a photo on smart glasses. A visual indicator shows that Assistant is activated and listening for Ren’s command. We collect this voice interaction, which includes any background sound that occurs when Ren says the command. Collecting Ren’s voice interactions lets us provide and, depending on Ren’s settings, improve the Assistant feature.

Metadata
--------

*   Information about the content itself, like the location where a photo was taken or the date a file was created
*   Information about the message itself, like the type of message or the date and time it was sent

--------------------------------------------------

Across Meta Company Products, you can interact with Meta’s generative AI features and experiences, collectively called [AI at Meta](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/genai?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.62-InformationYouOrOthersExchange).

We collect information when you or others use, or exchange information with, AI at Meta, such as:

*   Prompts that can include questions, messages, media and other information you or others share with or send to AI at Meta
*   Responses and other information you receive from AI at Meta. Sometimes these are provided with the help of our [AI integrations](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.62-InformationYouOrOthersExchange#4.subpage.15-AiIntegrations)
*   Actions you ask AI at Meta to take, like customizing the content or ads you see
*   Feedback you give to AI at Meta about its responses

For example, if you give us permission to access your device’s camera roll, we collect metadata. This metadata is from and about your photos and videos and includes the date and time they were made. We use this to do things like remind you when you have new photos to upload.

IP address
----------

Stands for "internet protocol address." It’s a unique number assigned to a device, like a phone or computer, that allows it to communicate over the internet. Numbers are assigned according to standard guidelines, or protocols.

Just like you need a mailing address to receive a letter from a friend, your device needs an IP address to receive information on the internet.

Information about the network you connect your device to and your internet connection
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Information about your network and connection includes:

*   The name of your mobile operator or internet service provider (ISP)
*   Language
*   Time zone
*   Mobile phone number
*   IP address
*   Connection and download speed
*   Network capability
*   Information about other devices that are nearby or on your network
*   Wi-Fi hotspots you connect to using our Products

One reason we collect this information is to make your experience better. For example, if we know that your phone and TV are connected to the same network, we can help you use your phone to control a video stream on your TV.

For some of these purposes, we use information [across Meta Company Products\[26\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A2-HowDoWeUse#annotation-26) from the accounts you choose to add to your Accounts Center, and [across your devices\[27\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A2-HowDoWeUse#annotation-27). The information we use for these purposes is automatically processed by our systems. But in some cases, we also use [manual review\[28\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A2-HowDoWeUse#annotation-28) to access and review your information.

To use less information that’s connected to individual users, in some cases we de-identify or aggregate information or anonymize it so that it no longer identifies you. We use this information in the same ways we use your information as described in this section.

If you choose to add your accounts to the same Accounts Center, we'll combine your [information across your accounts](https://www.meta.com/help/accounts-center/Information-used-across-accounts/?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A2.ex.5-UsingInformationAcrossOur) on Meta Company Products. We'll use your information to:

Adding multiple accounts to an Accounts Center is entirely optional. You can remove accounts from an Accounts Center at any time.

Even if you don't add your accounts on Meta Products to the same Accounts Center, we use information across your accounts to:

*   Keep you and others safe
*   More accurately count people and measure how they use our Products
*   Make sure our Products are working correctly so we can fix them if they’re not

When you add your WhatsApp account to an Accounts Center with other accounts on Meta Company Products:

Why we use information across devices
-------------------------------------

One reason we use your information across [devices\[39\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A2.ex.1-WhyWeUseInformation#annotation-39) is to help us give you a more personalized experience. For example, we might show you an ad on your phone, and later you might use your laptop to click on the ad and buy the product. By combining that information across your devices, we can understand what ads are relevant to you and help businesses measure how well their ad performed.

Manual review
-------------

### Examples of when we use manual review

*   Our reviewers help us promote safety, security and integrity across our Products. For example, reviewers can look for and remove content that violates our terms and policies and keep content that doesn’t break our terms and policies available. Their work supplements our [technology that detects violations](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Flm.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.fb.com%2Fen-gb%2Fenforcement%2Fdetecting-violations%2Ftechnology-detects-violations%2F%3Fentry_point%3DPOLICY_ANNOTATION%253A2.ex.2-ManualReviewExamplesOf).
*   When our algorithms detect that [someone might need help](https://www.facebook.com/safety/wellbeing/suicideprevention?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A2.ex.2-ManualReviewExamplesOf), a reviewer can review their post and offer support if needed.
*   We also use manual review to analyze content to train our algorithms to review content the same way a person would. This improves our automatic processing, which in turn helps us improve our products.

### Who reviews this information

Our reviewers work at Meta, for [Meta Companies](https://www.facebook.com/help/111814505650678?ref=tos&entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A2.ex.2-ManualReviewExamplesOf) or for a trusted [service provider\[40\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A2.ex.2-ManualReviewExamplesOf#annotation-40). We require every reviewer who's allowed access to your information to meet privacy and security standards.

-------------------------------------

This Policy describes the information we, Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, process to provide [Meta Products](https://www.facebook.com/legal/meta-products?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A0.ex.0-WhatProductsDoesThis), which we also call "Products."

Your activity on our Products
-----------------------------

For example, William checks into a local bakery on Facebook, so later we might show him ads on Instagram for other local bakeries.

Your activity on third-party websites and apps, depending on your settings
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

For example, Jane buys a pair of shoes from an online shoe store or in an online chat with a shoe seller. The seller shares Jane’s activity with us using our Business Tools, subject to our Business Tools Terms.

Later, Jane sees an ad on Instagram for a discount on her next shoe purchase from the online store.

If she doesn't want to see ads from this shoe store again, she can hide them in her [Advertisers setting](https://www.facebook.com/adpreferences/advertisers?entry_point=POLICY_STORY_ANNOTATION%3A2.story.6-YourActivityOnOur). Or if she doesn’t want us to show her any ads based on her activity on other websites and apps, she can make sure that this setting is turned off in her [Ad preferences](https://www.facebook.com/adpreferences/ad_settings?entry_point=POLICY_STORY_ANNOTATION%3A2.story.6-YourActivityOnOur).

Topics we think you might be interested in
------------------------------------------

For example, Jon likes several Facebook Pages about famous musicians, so we think he has an interest in "music."

Based on this interest, we might show him an ad for a local record shop or an online music publication.

Jon can manage his interests in his [ad topics](https://www.facebook.com/adpreferences/ad_topics?entry_point=POLICY_STORY_ANNOTATION%3A2.story.6-YourActivityOnOur).

Your connections
----------------

For example, Fiona’s friend likes an Instagram account for a local art fair. Based on her friend’s activity, we might show Fiona an ad for the art fair.

Other device signals we receive
-------------------------------

We receive different types of device signals from different operating systems. They include things like nearby Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections.

IP address
----------

Stands for "internet protocol address." It’s a unique number assigned to a device, like a phone or computer, that allows it to communicate over the internet. Numbers are assigned according to standard guidelines, or protocols.

Just like you need a mailing address to receive a letter from a friend, your device needs an IP address to receive information on the internet.

Personalizing ads for you and others
------------------------------------

For example, Marcus is going on a trip and wants to use Find Wi-Fi to find free, public Wi-Fi at the airport. He has turned on Location Services on his device and allowed location access on the Facebook app, so we can use his GPS information to help him find the most relevant public Wi-Fi networks. We’ll also use this information to show him ads for local businesses near the airport.

Later, Marcus turns off Location Services before he lands, so we don’t collect his GPS information anymore. Later on his trip, he opens the Facebook app, and we can use the IP address we receive to estimate Marcus’ general location and show him ads for businesses nearby.

Helping to keep your account secure
-----------------------------------

For example, we use information about the locations you normally log in from, combined with other information, to detect suspicious activity. So if we detect an attempt to log into your account from a new location, we can check that it’s really you.

Partner
-------

A person, business, organization or body using or integrating our Products to advertise, market or support their products and services

Information we provide about different types of people
------------------------------------------------------

For example, we might tell an advertiser that their ad was seen by women aged 25–34 who live in Madrid and like software engineering.

Third party
-----------

A person, business, organization or body that is not part of the Meta Companies

Providing more personalized features, content and suggestions across our Products
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For example we can:

*   Automatically fill in registration information, like your phone number, from one Meta Product when you sign up for an account on a different Product
*   Let others see and search your name and profile photo across our Products and communicate with you
*   Show all interactions in one place for content you’ve cross-posted to different Products

Device
------

Devices include computers, phones, hardware, connected TVs, Meta Quest and other web-connected devices.

Service provider
----------------

A person, business, organization or body that provides services to Meta or to our users on behalf of Meta. For example, our service providers do things like investigate suspicious activity and provide customer support.

How is your information shared on Meta Products or with integrated partners?
============================================================================

Highlights
----------

----------------

Learn more about the different cases when your information can be shared on our [Products\[41\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A3-HowIsYourInformation#annotation-41):

People and accounts you share and communicate with
--------------------------------------------------

When you share and communicate using our Products, you can sometimes [choose the audience\[42\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A3.subpage.1-PeopleAndAccountsYou#annotation-42) for what you share.

When you interact with people or businesses, they can see:

For example, the audience you choose can see when you:

*   Share a post you’ve written
*   Share a photo or video
*   Create a story
*   Share a news article

What you communicate with them
------------------------------

People you interact with can see what you send to them. So if you send a person or a business a message on Messenger or Instagram, that person or business can read your message.

People and businesses can also see some of your activity on our Products. This includes when you:

*   Comment on or react to others’ posts

When you’re active
------------------

Some of our Products might provide you with settings that allow others to see when you're active on our Products, such as “active status.” In some cases, we also offer settings that allow others to see when you’re active in a particular section of one of our Products, like a message thread, game or event, or when you last used one of our Products.

Learn how to update your Active Status on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/help/215888465102253?helpref=faq_content&entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A3.subpage.1-PeopleAndAccountsYou) and [Messenger](https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/278118979024443?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A3.subpage.1-PeopleAndAccountsYou), or how to update your Activity Status on [Instagram](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Flm.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F1164377657035425%3Fentry_point%3DPOLICY_SUBPAGE%253A3.subpage.1-PeopleAndAccountsYou).

When you interact with a supervised user
----------------------------------------

Some accounts are [supervised\[43\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A3.subpage.1-PeopleAndAccountsYou#annotation-43). When you interact with a supervised user, their parent or guardian can see some of your activity and information. This can include information like your username, profile picture and if the supervised user blocked you. On some Products, the supervised user can let their parent or guardian know if they reported you.

Content others share or reshare about you
-----------------------------------------

Who can see or reshare your content
-----------------------------------

People in your audience can view your content and can choose to share it with others outside your audience, on and off our Products. For example, when you share a post or send a message to specific friends, they can download, screenshot or reshare it with anyone, on, across or off our Products.

When you comment on a post or react to a photo, your comment or reaction can be seen by anyone who can see the post or photo. This can include people you aren’t connected to. The person who shared the post can also change their audience at any time after you’ve interacted with it.

When others interact with [AI at Meta](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/genai?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A3.subpage.2-ContentOthersShareOr), they can share information about you, including [messages and content you have shared\[44\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A3.subpage.2-ContentOthersShareOr#annotation-44).

With integrated partners
------------------------

You can choose to connect with [integrated partners\[46\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBSECTION%3A3.2-WithIntegratedPartnersYou#annotation-46) who use our Products. If you do, these integrated partners receive information about you and your activity.

These integrated partners can always access information that’s public on our Products. Learn more about other information they receive and how they handle your information:

When you use an integrated partner’s product or service
-------------------------------------------------------

Information they receive automatically
--------------------------------------

When you use an integrated partner’s products or services, they can access:

*   What you post or share from these products or services
*   What you use their services to do
*   Information from and about the device you’re using
*   The language setting you’ve chosen on our Products

[See examples\[47\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A3.subpage.4-WhenYouUseAn#annotation-47) of when an integrated partner might receive your information.

Information they receive with your permission
---------------------------------------------

Sometimes these integrated partners ask you for permission to access certain additional information from your Facebook, Instagram or Messenger account. In their request, they’ll explain what information they’d like to access and let you choose whether to share it.

On Facebook, this includes things like your email address, hometown or birthday. On Instagram, this includes content, like photos and videos, that you’ve shared from your account when the account was set to private.

[Learn what happens if you choose to share your friends list, or if your friends choose to share their friends list.\[48\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A3.subpage.4-WhenYouUseAn#annotation-48)

We automatically log when you receive a request from an integrated partner to access your information. These requests to access information are separate from the Apps and Websites access that you manage in your Facebook or Instagram Ad settings or in your mobile device settings.

How long they can access your information
-----------------------------------------

Apps or websites you’ve logged into using Facebook Login or connected to your Instagram account can access your nonpublic information on Meta Products unless it appears to us that you haven’t used the app or website in 90 days. Note that even if an app’s access to your information has expired, it can still retain information you shared with it previously.

We encourage you to visit your Apps and Websites settings from time to time to review which apps and websites continue to have access to your information through Facebook Login or Instagram.

When you interact with someone else’s content on an integrated partner’s product or service
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Integrated partners receive information about your activity when you interact with other Facebook, Instagram or Messenger users while they’re using the integrated partner’s product or service.

For example, a gamer livestreams to Facebook using a partner app. Then you comment on that livestream. The app developer will receive information about your comment.

How integrated partners handle your information
-----------------------------------------------

Integrated partners handle the information you share with them according to their own terms and policies, not Meta’s. You can review their privacy policy on their website or app to learn how they receive and process your information.

What Products does this Policy cover?
-------------------------------------

This Policy describes the information we, Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, process to provide [Meta Products](https://www.facebook.com/legal/meta-products?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A0.ex.0-WhatProductsDoesThis), which we also call "Products."

Choosing an audience
--------------------

On Facebook, the audience can be made up of:

*   The public, including people on and off Facebook
*   Your friends and other connections, such as the friends of people you tag
*   A customized list of people
*   Yourself
*   The members of a single community, such as a group

On Instagram, you can set the audience for what you share by choosing between a private or public account. With a [private account](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Flm.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F448523408565555%3Fentry_point%3DPOLICY_ANNOTATION%253A3.ex.2-ChoosingAnAudienceOn), only followers you approve can see what you share. With a public account, your posts and other content on Instagram can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if they don’t have an account. You can restrict the audience for your content by blocking individual accounts from viewing them. You can also create a close friends list for certain types of content that only the people on that list can see.

### Audience settings are different from app permissions

Your audience settings are different from the permissions you give to individual apps and websites to access your information. [Read our policy](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A3.ex.2-ChoosingAnAudienceOn#3.subpage.4-WhenYouUseAn) about how you may share information with integrated partners.

Supervision
-----------

Supervision provides supervisors chosen by a teen, like parents and guardians, with tools and insights to help support a teen account.

Information you or others exchange with AI at Meta
--------------------------------------------------

Across Meta Company Products, you can interact with Meta’s generative AI features and experiences, collectively called [AI at Meta](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/genai?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.62-InformationYouOrOthersExchange).

We collect information when you or others use, or exchange information with, AI at Meta, such as:

*   Prompts that can include questions, messages, media and other information you or others share with or send to AI at Meta
*   Responses and other information you receive from AI at Meta. Sometimes these are provided with the help of our [AI integrations](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.62-InformationYouOrOthersExchange#4.subpage.15-AiIntegrations)
*   Actions you ask AI at Meta to take, like customizing the content or ads you see
*   Feedback you give to AI at Meta about its responses

Search engines
--------------

You can visit your [privacy settings](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=privacy&entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A3.ex.5-SearchEnginesYouCan) to control whether search engines can show your profile or public photos and videos in search results outside of Meta. Some public content might still be accessible through search engines, for example:

*   If you post with your audience or profile set to Public,
*   If you post on public Pages or accounts, depending on the settings of that account,
*   If your public content is reshared by a professional account on Instagram.

Integrated partner
------------------

A partner who uses technologies that help you make a connection to them through our Products, including plugins, login, checkout experiences, instant games, and other such integrations

When an integrated partner might receive your information
---------------------------------------------------------

For example, you might use your Facebook login to play an online game with your Facebook friends. The game developer automatically receives information about your activities in the game.

When an integrated partner might receive your information
---------------------------------------------------------

Or you might use the Facebook Like button on an article posted on a news website. The website developer automatically receives information about your Like on their article.

Sharing friends lists
---------------------

### When you share your friends list

If you use Facebook Login to log into an app, the app developer might request access to your list of Facebook friends. Here's what happens if you give the app developer permission to view these lists:

*   They can view and access a list of your Facebook friends who use the same app and have given the app permission to access their list of friends. They can’t access nonpublic information about your friends or followers through this process. Note that the app developer will receive more information about your friends if your friends choose to share it themselves. They can share it by providing the information directly or giving the developer permission to access information from their account.
*   You’ll appear on friends lists that your Facebook friends can choose to share with the same app. You can remove this permission, or the app entirely, if you later decide that you don’t want to share your friends list with an app, or don’t want to appear on other friends lists shared with that app.

### When your friends share their friends list

Your friends might choose to share their friends lists with app developers through Facebook Login. But your friends can’t use Facebook Login to share nonpublic information about you.

How do we share information with third parties?
===============================================

Highlights
----------

We share certain information with:

*   Advertisers who show ads on our Products
*   Businesses we hire to market our Products for us
*   Businesses we hire to do things like offer customer service or conduct surveys
*   Researchers who use it to do things like innovate, advance technology, or improve people’s safety

We don’t sell your information, and we never will.

We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and we never will. We also require [partners\[49\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A4-HowDoWeShare#annotation-49) and other [third parties\[50\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A4-HowDoWeShare#annotation-50) to follow rules about how they can and cannot use and disclose the information we provide.

Here’s more detail about who we share information with:

Partners
--------

Advertisers and Audience Network publishers (if we show you ads)
----------------------------------------------------------------

### Advertisers

We provide advertisers with reports about the number and kinds of people who see and engage with their ads. These reports include information about the general demographics and interests of people who engaged with an advertiser’s ad. Then advertisers can better understand their audience. [See an example\[51\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.2-AdvertisersAndAudienceNetwork#annotation-51).

Meta also provides advertisers and their vendors with information about:

*   Ads people engaged with, if any
*   When people engaged with ads
*   Where that ad was shown (for example, on Instagram, or on Facebook)

We also confirm which ads you viewed that led you to take an action with an advertiser, such as downloading an advertiser's app. But we don't share information with these advertisers and their vendors that by itself can be used to contact or identify you, such as your name or email address, unless you [give us permission.\[52\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.2-AdvertisersAndAudienceNetwork#annotation-52)

### Audience Network publishers and their vendors

Meta Audience Network lets advertisers place ads with us that will be published on other apps and websites outside of Meta.

To help show you ads on their apps and websites, we share information with publishers who use Audience Network, as well as vendors who facilitate that use. For example, we share:

*   How many people see and engage with ads on publisher apps
*   Information related to or in response to a [publisher’s request](https://www.facebook.com/help/119468292028768?ref=shareable&entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.2-AdvertisersAndAudienceNetwork) to serve an ad on its app.

But we don't share information with these publishers and their vendors that by itself can be used to contact or identify you, such as your name or email address, unless you [give us permission\[52\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.2-AdvertisersAndAudienceNetwork#annotation-52).

Partners who use our analytics services
---------------------------------------

People rely on our [Products\[53\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.4-PartnersWhoUseOur#annotation-53), like business accounts, professional tools and Facebook Pages, to run and promote their businesses. Businesses use our analytics services to understand more about how people are using their content, features, products and services.

To provide these services, we use the [information we collect](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.4-PartnersWhoUseOur#1-WhatInformationDoWe) about you. We put this information into aggregate reports so that partners can see how well their content, features, products and services are performing and are able to understand things like users’ experience with such content, products and services.

These reports aggregate information like:

*   How many people interacted with our partners' content, products or services
*   The [general demographics and interests\[51\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.4-PartnersWhoUseOur#annotation-51) of the people who interacted with it
*   How people use our partners’ products and services to connect to Meta Products and the performance of their connection and networks

Advertisers also receive other information. [Read our Policy](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.4-PartnersWhoUseOur#4.subpage.2-AdvertisersAndAudienceNetwork) about how we share information with advertisers.

Partners who offer goods or services on our Products and commerce services platforms
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you choose to [make a transaction\[54\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.6-PartnersWhoOfferGoods#annotation-54), or otherwise choose to share information with a seller, creator, fundraiser, charity, payment services provider or [commerce services platform\[55\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.6-PartnersWhoOfferGoods#annotation-55), we share information with them and with any providers acting on their behalf.

Depending on how you interact with them, they receive:

*   Information to complete your transaction, like order, payment, contact and shipping information
*   Information to help ensure the security of the transaction, like information about your device or connection
*   Any information required by applicable regulation
*   Other information you choose to share with them

For example, if you donate to a charity that receives funds through PayPal Giving Fund, your donation will be made to PayPal Giving Fund. The PayPal Giving Fund will receive information such as the transaction amount and name of the charity. Their payment service provider will also receive information needed to facilitate the payment, including your payment card credential information.

Integrated partners
-------------------

When you choose to use integrated partners’ products or services, they may receive information about you and your activity. [Read the Policy](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.8-IntegratedPartnersWhenYou#3.subpage.4-WhenYouUseAn).

Vendors

Measurement vendors
-------------------

We don’t create every measurement and analytics report ourselves.

We share information (like whether people saw an ad or engaged with it) with our [measurement vendors\[56\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.10-MeasurementVendors#annotation-56), who aggregate or compile it to provide their reports.

For example, an advertiser might ask a measurement vendor to help figure out the impact its ads on Facebook have had on sales. The measurement vendor compares information from us about clicks on the advertiser’s Facebook ads with information from the advertiser about product purchases. Then the measurement vendor creates and provides aggregated reports that show the advertiser how its ads are performing.

Marketing vendors
-----------------

We share information about you with [marketing vendors\[57\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.11-MarketingVendors#annotation-57). For example, we share your device identifier or other identifiers with marketing vendors to help us serve you ads most relevant to your interests.

Marketing vendors support our marketing and advertising efforts by:

*   Serving our advertisements across the internet, including on mobile, desktop and connected television devices
*   Tracking and categorizing your online and mobile app activity
*   Providing us information about your interests and community and advertising interactions

These marketing vendors help us understand who might find our advertising most relevant to their interests, and which of our Products might interest you. This information can be used to personalize which of our ads are shown to you. Marketing vendors also use this information to measure response to our marketing efforts and the effectiveness of our advertising.

Service providers
-----------------

Service providers
-----------------

Service providers provide services to us that help us provide our Products to you. We share the information we have about you to receive these services, which include:

*   Investigating suspicious activity
*   Detecting and stopping threats to our personnel and property
*   Facilitating payments
*   Providing customer support
*   Improving the functionality of our Products
*   Providing technical infrastructure services
*   Analyzing how our Products are used
*   Conducting research and surveys
*   Marketing and promoting our Products

Third parties
-------------

External researchers
--------------------

We provide information to external researchers. They use it to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation, and to promote safety, security and integrity.

Research goals include supporting:

*   Our business or mission
*   Social good. [Learn more](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.14-ExternalResearchersWeProvide).
*   Technological advancement
*   Safety and security on our Products
*   Public interest
*   Health and well-being

When sharing information with external researchers, we ensure the privacy of our users is protected. [Learn more](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Flm.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.fb.com%2Fen-gb%2Fresearchtools%2F%3Fentry_point%3DPOLICY_SUBPAGE%253A4.subpage.14-ExternalResearchersWeProvide) about the privacy-safe research we support.

AI integrations
---------------

Generative AI models that make our features work may not have the most complete or recent information. For example, that means if you ask Meta AI about the score to yesterday's football game, it might not know the right answer. That's why we work with other selected partners, like search engine providers. We sometimes share certain information with these partners so we can bring you the most relevant information.

[Learn more about how we share your information with these selected partners](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/dialog/ai-partners?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.15-AiIntegrations)

Other third parties
-------------------

We also share information with other [third parties\[50\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A4-HowDoWeShare#annotation-50) in response to legal requests, to comply with applicable law or to prevent harm. [Read the Policy](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A4-HowDoWeShare#10-HowDoWeRespond).

And if we sell or transfer all or part of our business to someone else, in some cases we’ll give the new owner your information as part of that transaction, but only as the law allows.

Partner
-------

A person, business, organization or body using or integrating our Products to advertise, market or support their products and services

Third party
-----------

A person, business, organization or body that is not part of the Meta Companies

General demographics and interests
----------------------------------

For example, a bike shop creates a Page on Facebook and wants to place an ad to reach an audience of people in Atlanta interested in cycling. We determine whether someone fits in this audience based on, for example, whether they liked a Page about bikes. Then people in that audience could see the bike shop's ad.

You can see the “interests” assigned to you in your [Ad preferences](https://accountscenter.facebook.com/ad_preferences/) and remove them if you want.

The bike shop can then see reports showing aggregated statistics about the audience seeing their ads and how their ads are performing. The reports would show statistics to the advertiser that, for example, most of the people who saw or clicked on their ad:

*   Were women
*   Were between the ages of 25 and 34
*   Clicked on the ad from their phone

When you might give us permission
---------------------------------

For example, you might request more information from a business by clicking their ad in your Facebook Feed and submitting a form with your name and contact information. Then the advertiser would receive the information you provided.

How do the Meta Companies work together?
========================================

Highlights
----------

*   Meta owns Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Meta Quest and the other Products covered by this Policy
*   Meta also owns the Meta Companies, which include WhatsApp
*   Sometimes we share information within these Companies
*   We do this to make new features or shared experiences between different products
*   We also share information, like your name and email address, to help verify your accounts, and check out suspicious activities. This helps us keep your accounts safe.

We are part of the [Meta Companies](https://www.facebook.com/help/111814505650678?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A5-HowDoTheMeta) that provide Meta Company Products. [Meta Company Products](https://www.facebook.com/legal/meta-company-products?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A5-HowDoTheMeta) include all the [Meta Products\[58\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A5-HowDoTheMeta#annotation-58) covered by this Policy, plus other products like WhatsApp and more.

We share information we collect, infrastructure, systems and technology with the other Meta Companies. [Learn more](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A5-HowDoTheMeta#9-HowDoWeTransfer) about how we transfer information to other countries.

We also process information that we receive about you from other Meta Companies, according to their terms and policies and as permitted by applicable law. In some cases, Meta acts as a [service provider\[59\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A5-HowDoTheMeta#annotation-59) for other Meta Companies. We act on their behalf and in accordance with their instructions and terms.

-------------------------------------

Service provider
----------------

A person, business, organization or body that provides services to Meta or to our users on behalf of Meta. For example, our service providers do things like investigate suspicious activity and provide customer support.

Why we share across the Meta Companies

### Promoting safety, security and integrity and complying with applicable law

For example, we share information with Meta Companies that provide financial products and services to help them promote safety, security and integrity and comply with applicable law. This includes:

*   Complying with their legal obligations
*   Helping keep you and others safe
*   Performing account verification
*   Investigating suspicious activities
*   Creating analytics

For these purposes, we might share your name, email address, who you’re friends with and other account information within the Meta Companies.

### Developing and providing features and integrations

*   Use your Meta Pay account to pay for things on WhatsApp
*   Chat with your friends on other Meta Company Products, such as smart glasses, by connecting your WhatsApp account

We also share information with Meta Companies to support innovation. For example, your videos can help train our products to recognize objects, like trees, or activities, like when a dog chases a ball. They can also help train tools that let people and businesses create content, like images and videos. This technology is used to help us offer new products or features in the future.

### Understanding how people use our products

We count the number of unique users, monthly active users and daily active users on our products. This information helps us understand the community using our products and publicly share important trends about how our products are used.

What Products does this Policy cover?
-------------------------------------

This Policy describes the information we, Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, process to provide [Meta Products](https://www.facebook.com/legal/meta-products?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A0.ex.0-WhatProductsDoesThis), which we also call "Products."

Third party

A person, business, organization or body that is not part of the Meta Companies

How long do we keep your information?
=====================================

Highlights
----------

*   We keep information for as long as we need it to provide a feature or service
*   But you can request that we delete your information
*   We’ll delete that information unless we have to keep it for something else, like for legal reasons

We keep information as long as we need it to provide our Products, comply with legal obligations or protect our or other’s interests. We decide how long we need information on a case-by-case basis. Here’s what we consider when we decide:

*   If we need it to operate or provide our Products. For example, we need to keep some of your information to maintain your account. [Learn more\[63\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A8-HowLongDoWe#annotation-63).
*   The feature we use it for, and how that feature works. For example, messages sent using Messenger’s vanish mode are retained for less time than regular messages. [Learn more\[64\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A8-HowLongDoWe#annotation-64).
*   How long we need to retain the information to comply with certain legal obligations. [See some examples\[65\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A8-HowLongDoWe#annotation-65).
*   If we need it for other legitimate purposes, such as to prevent harm; investigate possible violations of our terms or policies; promote safety, security and integrity; or protect ourselves, including our rights, property or products

In some instances and for specific reasons, we’ll keep information for an extended period of time. [Read our Policy\[66\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A8-HowLongDoWe#annotation-66) about when we may preserve your information.

If we need it to operate or provide our Products
------------------------------------------------

For example, we keep profile information, photos you’ve posted (and not deleted) and security information for the lifetime of your account.

And when you search for something on Facebook, we keep your search history until you clear the search in your [activity log](https://www.facebook.com/0/allactivity?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A8.ex.1-IfWeNeedIt) or delete your account. Once you clear a search or delete your account, it will no longer be visible to you, and it will be [deleted\[67\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A8.ex.1-IfWeNeedIt#annotation-67).

But even if you don’t clear your search or delete your account, within six months of your search we delete information about that search that isn’t necessary to show you your search history, like information about the device you were using, or your location.

The feature we use it for, and how that feature works
-----------------------------------------------------

For example, May is planning a surprise party for Yang. She sends Cynthia the party details in Messenger using vanish mode so that the message will disappear. The message will no longer be visible to May once she leaves the chat, and Cynthia will see the message only the first time she opens the chat thread.

After Cynthia reads the message, the content is deleted after one hour. If Cynthia never reads it, it’s deleted after 14 days.

How long we need to retain the information to comply with certain legal obligations
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For example, we retain information for as long as we need it for:

*   A legal request or obligation, including obligations of Meta Companies or to comply with applicable law
*   A governmental investigation
*   A legal claim, complaint, litigation or regulatory proceedings

Why we may preserve your information longer

*   **Permanently delete your account.** If you delete your account on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/help/224562897555674?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A6.ex.2-DeleteYourInformationOr) or [Instagram](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Flm.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F370452623149242%3Fentry_point%3DPOLICY_ANNOTATION%253A6.ex.2-DeleteYourInformationOr), we delete your information, including the things you’ve posted, such as your photos and status updates, unless we need to keep it as described in ["How long do we keep your information?"](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A6.ex.2-DeleteYourInformationOr#8-HowLongDoWe) Once your account is [permanently deleted](https://www.facebook.com/help/250563911970368/?ref=dp&entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A6.ex.2-DeleteYourInformationOr) you won’t be able to reactivate it, and you won’t be able to retrieve information, including content you’ve posted.

### How long does it take to delete your information?

If you request that we delete your account or content, it may take up to 90 days to delete your information after we begin the account deletion process or receive a content deletion request. After the information is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery.

If you leave your deleted content in your trash on Facebook or your Recently Deleted folder on Instagram, the deletion process will begin automatically in 30 days. Or you can start the deletion process right away by deleting the content from your trash or Recently Deleted folder.

Examples of why we might preserve your information
--------------------------------------------------

### To respond to a legal request

For example, we might preserve your information after you delete your account when we receive a valid legal request, such as a preservation order or search warrant, related to your account.

### To comply with applicable law

For example, we preserve certain information about purchases or transactions associated with an account, in line with Meta’s accounting obligations.

### For safety, security and integrity purposes

For example, if we disable an account for violating our terms or policies, we preserve information about that user to prevent them from opening a new account.

We also might preserve some of your account information as part of our review of suspicious activity. This includes any suspicious activity associated with our financial products, like suspected money laundering or terrorist funding.

### For litigation

We may preserve your information where we deem it necessary for reasons related to a legal claim or complaint. For example, we may be required to defend ourselves in legal proceedings in a claim related to your information.

Compliance with a legal obligation
----------------------------------

The categories of information we use, why we process your information based on compliance with a legal obligation and how it’s processed are set out below:

Processing information when required by law

**Why and how we process your information:**

For processing information when the law requires it: Where we are under an obligation to disclose information such as, for example, if we receive a valid legal request for certain information (such as an Irish search warrant), we will access, preserve and / or share your information with regulators, law enforcement or others.

The way in which the information will be processed depends on the specific circumstances, see [How do we respond to legal requests, prevent harm and promote safety and integrity?](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBSECTION%3A18.3-ComplianceWithALegal#10-HowDoWeRespond) for more. [Information for Law Enforcement Authorities](https://www.facebook.com/safety/groups/law/guidelines?entry_point=POLICY_SUBSECTION%3A18.3-ComplianceWithALegal) provides information on the operational guidelines law enforcement needs to follow.

Examples of Irish and EU laws enforceable in Ireland that could give rise to an obligation requiring us to process the information we hold about you are:

*   Civil and commercial matters: where we are in receipt of a court order or otherwise required to disclose information for the purposes of court proceedings, such as under Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters.
*   Criminal matters: to comply with requests from Irish law enforcement to provide information in relation to an investigation, such as under Section 10 of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997 as amended by 6(1)(a) of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, or to take steps to report information to law enforcement where required.
*   Consumer matters: to comply with our obligations under consumer law such as the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014.
*   Corporate and taxation matters: to comply with our obligations such as the Companies Act 2014.
*   Regulatory matters: to comply with our obligations to engage with regulators, such as the Data Protection Commission under the General Data Protection Regulation and the Data Protection Act 2018.
*   Financial matters: to comply with our obligations under applicable financial services law such as the European Union (Payment Services) Regulations 2018
*   Access matters: to provide data to public sector bodies, the EU Commission, EU Central Bank or other EU bodies upon request from them, to provide data to you or your requested third party when requested by you, for example under EU Regulation 2023/2854 (Data Act)

View the [current list of laws](https://www.facebook.com/help/264930705713965?entry_point=POLICY_SUBSECTION%3A18.3-ComplianceWithALegal) which are enforceable in Ireland that give rise to a legal obligation for Meta which results in the processing of information. New laws may be enacted or other obligations may become binding on our processing of your information which may require us to process your information and we will update this list from time to time.

**Information categories we use (see '[What Information do we collect?](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBSECTION%3A18.3-ComplianceWithALegal#1-WhatInformationDoWe)' for more detail on each information category). The actual information we use depends on your factual circumstances, but could include any of the following:**

The categories of information depend on the specific circumstances of each mandatory request or obligation. Only the information necessary to comply with the relevant legal obligation will be processed. For example, for civil matters, this will typically include limited information (such as contact details and login information). However, depending on the circumstances it could include the following:

Protecting the vital interests of you and/or those of another person: We apply automated processing techniques, conduct manual (human) review and share information, including with law enforcement and others, in circumstances where someone’s vital interests require protection, such as in the case of emergencies. These vital interests include protection of your life, physical or mental health, wellbeing or integrity or that of others, and detecting, removing, and reporting illegal content. In protecting such vital interests we aim to combat harmful conduct and promote safety, integrity and security, including, for example, when we are investigating reports of harmful conduct or taking appropriate action, such as sharing information with relevant authorities, when someone needs help.

How our ads system works
------------------------

Our ads system works in the following way:

*   **We use your information to determine the ad interests most relevant to you.** We try to predict your ad interests based on the information we have, including any choices you've made in Ad preferences.
*   **Advertisers tell us which audience they want to reach based on who they think will be most interested.** This can include things like age, gender, location where advertisers want to show their ad or interests, such as women, based in Dublin, who like golf.
*   **We review the potential ads that we could show you to identify the most relevant ones.** Our ads system automatically reviews all the potential ads where you might fit the audience that advertisers want to reach. For example, you may see potential ads because you match the age range and interest category. We determine which ones to show you based on things like whether it best achieves the advertiser’s goal and is most relevant to you. To do this, we use algorithms and machine learning to order the ads we may show you. We use different factors such as the ad quality, the advertiser's desired audience and budget. We also consider how likely we think it is that you will react to the ad based on things like your activity on Meta Products. [Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/447278887528796?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A11.ex.1-HowOurAdsSystemWorks).
*   **All of this information helps us show you the most relevant ads.** When you see ads on Meta Company Products, we use this process to choose the most relevant ad to show you.

How we promote safety, security and integrity
---------------------------------------------

We share your information with law enforcement, government authorities, Meta Companies and other third parties (including industry peers) when we have a good faith belief it’s necessary to detect, prevent and address a variety of situations, such as:
