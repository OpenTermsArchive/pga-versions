------------------------------------------------------------

Partners use our [Business Tools](https://www.facebook.com/help/331509497253087/), integrations and Meta Audience Network technologies to share information with us.

These Partners collect your information when you visit their site or app or use their services, or through other businesses or organizations they work with. We require Partners to have the right to collect, use and share your information before giving it to us.

Information we collect if you use our Products but don’t have an account
------------------------------------------------------------------------

For example, we collect:

* Browser and app logs of your visits to public content, like Facebook Pages, videos and [rooms](https://www.facebook.com/help/211931886925431/)
* Basic information about devices that downloaded our apps, like device model and OS

We also receive information using cookies and similar technologies, like the Meta Pixel or Social Plugins, when you visit other websites and apps that use Meta Products. Read our [Cookies Policy](https://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies) to learn more.

Examples of why we collect information
--------------------------------------

### Security of our Products

For example, if we see someone without an account trying to load too many pages, they could be trying to [scrape](https://www.facebook.com/help/463983701520800/?helpref=search) our site in violation of our terms. Then we can take action to prevent it.

### Safety and integrity

For example, if someone without an account joins a room and shares a harmful video, we can take action according to our Community Standards. We can remove content that violates our terms and policies, or share information with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of death or imminent bodily harm.

### Performance

For example, we use information we have about people who use our Products, even if they don’t have an account, to measure how fast our pages load in different countries. This helps us identify and fix issues with local networks.

4

Information you provide
-----------------------

For example, when you create a Facebook account, you must provide some information, like a password and your email address or phone number. You might choose to add other details to your account, like a profile photo or payment information.

We also collect information you provide when you:

* Create your avatar
* Fill out a form
* Contact us

5

Audio content you create
------------------------

You can create audio content, like if you're a host or speaker in a Live Audio Room. Live Audio can be listened to by anyone in the audience for the broadcast.

6

What we collect from our camera feature
---------------------------------------

José likes using Instagram’s Camera feature to take pictures of his friends. We collect information about how José uses the Camera feature, including what he sees through the camera lens on his device while he’s using the feature. This helps us do things like suggest masks and filters that he might like.

How filters, effects, masks and avatars work
--------------------------------------------

If you use our camera or allow access to photos and videos, on certain Meta Products you can add filters, effects, masks or avatars. Some of these features process parts of faces or bodies within the camera frame, photo or video. Then they can do things like fit a mask correctly over the eyes, nose and mouth. The information we use for this process is used to create the feature. It’s not used to identify you.

What we collect from voice-enabled features
-------------------------------------------

Ren tells Meta’s voice-enabled Assistant to take a photo on Ray-Ban Stories. A visual indicator shows that Assistant is activated and listening for Ren’s command. We collect this voice interaction, which includes any background sound that occurs when Ren says the command. Collecting Ren’s voice interactions lets us provide and, depending on Ren’s settings, improve the Assistant feature.

7

Metadata about content or messages
----------------------------------

Metadata is:

* Information about the content itself, like the location where a photo was taken or the date a file was created
* Information about the message itself, like the type of message or the date and time it was sent

* Billing, shipping and contact details
* Items you bought and how many
* Other account and authentication information

### Why we collect this information

One reason we store this information is to allow you to access and view your payment and transaction history.

And you can use it the next time you shop to give you easier, faster shopping experiences.

* We send messages about the Products we know you use, using the email you register to your account
* Depending on your settings, we send marketing communications about Products you might like
* We ask you to participate in research based on things like how you use our Products
* We let you know about our policies and terms of service
* When you contact us with questions, we reply to your email
* We facilitate customer support communications with you when you've told us, either directly or through a third party, that you have questions or concerns about our Products

Researching and innovating for social good
------------------------------------------

We research and innovate to help people around the world. Our goals include:

* Contributing to social good and areas of public interest
* Advancing technology
* Improving safety, health and well-being

Here are some examples of our research:

* [We analyze information](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/dfg/tools/displacement-maps) about where groups of people go during crises. This helps relief organizations get aid to the right places.
* We work with independent researchers to better understand the impact social media might have on elections and democratic processes
* We’ve collaborated with academics and industry experts to help improve internet access and quality in rural areas
* We support research in areas like artificial intelligence and machine learning to do things like create [COVID-19 forecasting models](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Flm.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fdataforgood.fb.com%2Ftools%2Fcovid-19-forecasts%2F)

22

Using information across our Products
-------------------------------------

We use [information across your accounts on our Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/373389520856284/) to:

* Personalize ads for you and others. [Learn more](#2.subpage.2-HowWeShowAds).
* Measure the performance of those ads. [Learn more](#2.subpage.10-ProvidingMeasurementAnalyticsAnd).
* Provide more personalized features, content and suggestions across our Products. [See examples\[32\]](#annotation-32).
* More accurately count people and understand how they use our Products
* Help keep you and others safe. [Learn more](#2.subpage.8-PromotingSafetySecurityAnd).

If you set up your [Accounts Center](https://www.facebook.com/help/943858526073065/), we also use your information to offer [connected experiences](https://www.facebook.com/help/509817036774018/) and improve your experiences across accounts. [See an example.\[33\]](#annotation-33)

23

Why we use information across devices
-------------------------------------

One reason we use your information across devices is to help us give you a more personalized experience. For example, we might show you an ad on your phone, and later you might use your laptop to click on the ad and buy the product. By combining that information across your devices, we can understand what ads are relevant to you and help businesses measure how well their ad performed.

24

Manual review
-------------

### Examples of when we use manual review

* Our reviewers help us promote safety, security and integrity across our Products. For example, reviewers can look for and remove content that violates our terms and policies and keep content that doesn’t break our terms and policies available. Their work supplements our [technology that detects violations](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Flm.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.fb.com%2Fen-gb%2Fenforcement%2Fdetecting-violations%2Ftechnology-detects-violations%2F).
* When our algorithms detect that [someone might need help](https://www.facebook.com/safety/wellbeing/suicideprevention), a reviewer can review their post and offer support if needed.
* We also use manual review to analyze content to train our algorithms to review content the same way a person would. This improves our automatic processing, which in turn helps us improve our products.

### Who reviews this information

Our reviewers work at Meta, for [Meta Companies](https://www.facebook.com/help/111814505650678?ref=tos) or for a trusted vendor. We require every reviewer who's allowed access to your information to meet privacy and security standards.

[Learn more](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Flm.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.fb.com%2Fpolicies%2Fimproving%2Fprioritizing-content-review%2F) about how Facebook prioritizes content for manual review.

25

How we personalize your Facebook Feed
-------------------------------------

Your Facebook Feed is unique to you. We order (or “rank”) the content you can see in your Feed, and you can [learn more](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Flm.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.fb.com%2Fen-gb%2Ffeatures%2Franking-and-content%2F) about the different types of signals we use to rank it. We also suggest content that’s relevant to you.

Many things influence the content you see in your Feed.

For example:

* If your friends, connections or people you may know interact with a Facebook Page, post or certain topic, we can suggest similar content to you. So if your friend Ahmad comments on a post about national parks, we can suggest the national parks post to you.
* If you and others interact with the same group, Facebook Page or post, we can suggest another group, Page or post that they interact with for you. So if you and Sharmila are in the same cat lovers group and Sharmila likes a Page that sells scarves, we might suggest the scarves Page to you.
* If you’ve recently engaged with a certain topic on Facebook, we might then suggest other posts that are related to that topic. So if you recently liked or commented on a post from a basketball Page, we could suggest other posts about basketball.
* You might see posts based on where you are and what people near you are interacting with on Facebook. So if you’re near a sports stadium, we can suggest games or events occurring at the stadium. [Learn more](#2.subpage.6-HowWeUseLocation) about how we use location-related information.

[Manage your Facebook Feed preferences Facebook Help Center](https://www.facebook.com/help/964154640320617/control-what-you-see-in-news-feed)

26

Your activity on our Products
-----------------------------

For example, William checks into a local bakery on Facebook, so later we might show him ads on Instagram for other local bakeries.

Your activity on websites and apps, depending on your settings
--------------------------------------------------------------

For example, Jane buys a pair of shoes from an online shoe store. The store shares Jane’s activity with us using our Business Tools, subject to our Business Tools Terms.

Later, Jane sees an ad on Instagram for a discount on her next shoe purchase from the online store.

If she doesn't want to see more ads from this shoe store, she can hide them in her [advertisers setting](https://www.facebook.com/adpreferences/advertisers). Or if she doesn’t want us to show her any ads based on her activity on other websites and apps, she can make sure that this setting is turned off in her [ad settings](https://www.facebook.com/adpreferences/ad_settings)

Topics we think you might be interested in
------------------------------------------

For example, Jon likes several Facebook Pages about famous musicians, so we think he has an interest in "music."

Based on this interest, we might show him an ad for a local record shop or an online music publication.

Your connections
----------------

For example, Fiona’s friend likes an Instagram account for a local art fair. Based on her friend’s activity, we might show Fiona an ad for the art fair.

27

Other device signals we receive
-------------------------------

We receive different types of device signals from different operating systems. They include things like nearby Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections.

28

IP addresses
------------

IP address stands for "internet protocol address." It’s a unique number assigned to a device, like a phone or computer, that allows it to communicate over the internet. Numbers are assigned according to standard guidelines, or protocols.

Just like you need a mailing address to receive a letter from a friend, your device needs an IP address to receive information on the internet.

29

Personalizing ads for you and others
------------------------------------

For example, Marcus is going on a trip and wants to use Find Wi-Fi to find free, public Wi-Fi at the airport. He has turned on Location Services, so we can use his GPS information to help him find the most relevant public Wi-Fi networks. We’ll also use this information to show him ads for local businesses near the airport.

Later, Marcus turns off Location Services before he lands, so we don’t collect his GPS information anymore. Later on his trip, he opens the Facebook app, and we can use the IP address we receive to estimate Marcus’ current location and show him ads for businesses nearby.

30

Helping to keep your account secure
-----------------------------------

For example, we use information about the locations you normally log in from, combined with other information, to detect suspicious activity. So if we detect an attempt to log into your account from a new location, we can check that it’s really you.

31

Information we provide about different types of people
------------------------------------------------------

For example, we might tell an advertiser that their ad was seen by women aged 25–34 who live in Madrid and like software engineering.

32

Providing more personalized features, content and suggestions across our Products
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For example we can:

* Automatically fill in registration information, like your phone number, from one Meta Product when you sign up for an account on a different Product
* Let others see and search your name and profile photo across our Products and communicate with you
* Show all interactions in one place for content you’ve cross-posted to different Products

33

Using your information if you set up your Accounts Center
---------------------------------------------------------

For example, if you follow your favorite team on Instagram, we can more easily suggest that you follow that team’s Page on Facebook.

[Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/994989784595330/) about how we use information across accounts if you set up Accounts Center.

Other content you can choose to set to Public, like posts, photos and videos you post to your profile, Stories or Reels.

Who can see public content?
---------------------------

When content is public, it can be seen by anyone on or across our Products, and in some cases off our Products, even if they don’t have an account.

For example, if you comment on Marketplace, a public Facebook Page or a public Instagram account, or if you leave a rating or review, your comment, rating or review will be visible to anyone. It could appear in any of our Products or be seen by anyone, including off our Products.

With Integrated Partners
------------------------

You can choose to connect with [Integrated Partners\[36\]](#annotation-36) who use our Products. If you do, these Integrated Partners receive information about you and your activity.

These Integrated Partners can always access information that’s public on our Products. Learn more about other information they receive and how they handle your information:

When you use an Integrated Partner’s product or service
-------------------------------------------------------

Information they receive automatically
--------------------------------------

When you use an Integrated Partner’s products or services, they can access:

* What you post or share from these products or services
* What you use their services to do
* Information from and about the device you’re using

[See examples\[37\]](#annotation-37) of when an Integrated Partner might receive your information.

Information they receive with your permission
---------------------------------------------

Sometimes these Integrated Partners ask you for permission to access certain additional information from your Facebook, Instagram or Messenger account. In their request, they’ll explain what information they’d like to access and let you choose whether to share it.

On Facebook, this includes things like your email address, hometown or birthday. On Instagram, this includes content, like photos and videos, that you’ve shared from your account when the account was set to private.

[Learn what happens if you choose to share your friends list, or if your friends choose to share their friends list.\[38\]](#annotation-38)

We automatically log when you receive a request from an Integrated Partner to access your information. These requests to access information are separate from the Apps and Websites access that you manage in your Facebook or Instagram ad settings or in your mobile device settings.

How long they can access your information
-----------------------------------------

Apps or websites you’ve logged into using Facebook Login or connected to your Instagram account can access your nonpublic information on Meta Products unless it appears to us that you haven’t used the app or website in 90 days. Note that even if an app’s access to your data has expired, it can still retain information you shared with it previously.

We encourage you to visit your [Apps and Websites settings](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/logging/?target=POLICY_PLATFORM_LINK_COLLECTION%3AMANAGE_APPS&element=privacy_policy_inline_text&containing_element_id=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A3.subpage.4-WhenYouUseAn&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmbasic.facebook.com%2Fprivacy%2Fpolicy%2Fprintable%2F%3Fback_id%3Dlink-collection-5%26link_dialog%3DMANAGE_APPS%26entry%3D0) from time to time to review which apps and websites continue to have access to your information through Facebook Login or Instagram.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Integrated Partners receive information about your activity when you interact with other Facebook, Instagram or Messenger users while they’re using the Integrated Partner’s product or service.

For example, a gamer livestreams to Facebook using a partner app. Then you comment on that livestream. The app developer will receive information about your comment.

How Integrated Partners handle your information
-----------------------------------------------

Integrated Partners handle the information you share with them according to their own terms and policies, not Meta’s. You can review their privacy policy on their website or app to learn how they receive and process your information.

Choosing an audience
--------------------

On Facebook, the audience can be made up of:

* The public, including people on and off Facebook
* Your friends and other connections, such as the friends of people you tag
* A customized list of people
* Yourself
* The members of a single community, such as a group

On Instagram, you can set the audience for what you share by choosing between a private or public account. With a [private account](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Flm.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F448523408565555), only followers you approve can see what you share. With a public account, your posts and other content on Instagram can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if they don’t have an account. You can restrict the audience for your content by blocking individual accounts from viewing them. You can also create a close friends list for certain types of content that only the people on that list can see.

Search engines
--------------

You can visit your [privacy settings](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=privacy) to control whether search engines outside Facebook can link to your profile. But other public content–like if you post with your audience set to Public, or post on public Pages or accounts–might still be accessible through search engines, depending on the settings of that account.

36

Our Partners
------------

Businesses and people can use our Products to advertise, market or support their products and services. When they use our Products, we call them our Partners.

Our Products include our Business Tools and other technologies that allow businesses to advertise or support their products and services, or to understand and measure how people are using their services and how well their ads are working. For example, they might put one of our Business Tools, the Meta Pixel, on their website. Or they might use Meta Audience Network tools to monetize their apps by showing ads from businesses that advertise on Facebook.

Our Products also include technologies where you can make a connection to our Partners through our Products. For example, you might log into their app or website using Facebook Login. Or you might play their game on Facebook, which we call an integration because you can play without leaving our app. We call the Partners who use these integrated tools our Integrated Partners.

Here are some examples of our Partners:

* Advertisers
* Companies that measure how well ads are doing and provide reports
* Businesses and people that use our Products to sell or offer goods and services
* Publishers (like a website or app) and their business partners
* App developers
* Game developers

37

When an Integrated Partner might receive your information
---------------------------------------------------------

For example, you might use your Facebook login to play an online game with your Facebook friends. The game developer automatically receives information about your activities in the game.

When an Integrated Partner might receive your information
---------------------------------------------------------

Or you might use the Facebook Like button on an article posted on a news website. The website developer automatically receives information about your Like on their article.

38

Sharing friends lists
---------------------

### When you share your friends list

If you use Facebook Login to log into an app, the app developer might request access to your list of Facebook friends. Here's what happens if you give the app developer permission to view these lists:

* They can view and access a list of your Facebook friends who use the same app and have given the app permission to access their list of friends. They can’t access nonpublic information about your friends or followers through this process. Note that the app developer will receive more information about your friends if your friends choose to share it themselves. They can share it by providing the information directly or giving the developer permission to access information from their account.
* You’ll appear on friends lists that your Facebook friends can choose to share with the same app. You can remove this permission, or the app entirely, if you later decide that you don’t want to share your friends list with an app, or don’t want to appear on other friends lists shared with that app.

### When your friends share their friends list

Your friends might choose to share their friends lists with app developers through Facebook Login. But your friends can’t use Facebook Login to share nonpublic information about you.

How do we share information with Partners, vendors, service providers and third parties?
========================================================================================

We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and we never will. We also require Partners and third parties to follow rules about how they can and cannot use and disclose the information we provide.

Here’s more detail about who we share information with:

Partners
--------

Advertisers and Audience Network publishers
-------------------------------------------

### Advertisers

We provide advertisers with reports about the number and kinds of people who see and engage with their ads. These reports include information about the general demographics and interests of people who engaged with an advertiser’s ad. Then advertisers can better understand their audience. [See an example\[39\]](#annotation-39).

Meta also provides advertisers and their business partners with information about:

* Ads people engaged with, if any
* When people engaged with ads
* Where that ad was shown (for example, on Instagram, or on Facebook)

But we don't share information with these advertisers and their business partners that by itself can be used to contact or identify you, such as your name or email address, unless you [give us permission.\[40\]](#annotation-40)

### Audience Network publishers and their business partners

Meta Audience Network lets advertisers place ads with us that will be published on apps outside of Meta.

To help show you ads on their apps, we share information with publishers who use Audience Network, as well as business partners who facilitate that use. For example, we share:

* How many people see and engage with ads on publisher apps
* Information related to or in response to a [publisher’s request](https://www.facebook.com/help/119468292028768?ref=shareable) to serve an ad on its app.

But we don't share information with these publishers and their business partners that by itself can be used to contact or identify you, such as your name or email address, unless you [give us permission\[40\]](#annotation-40).

Partners who use our analytics services
---------------------------------------

People rely on our Products, like business accounts, professional tools and Facebook Pages, to run and promote their businesses. Businesses use our analytics services to understand more about how people are using their content and features.

We receive information about how people interact with their posts, listings, Facebook Pages, videos, Shops or other content, on and off our Products. Then we put this information into aggregate reports so they can see how well their content is performing.

These reports aggregate information like:

* How many people interacted with their content
* [The general demographics and interests\[39\]](#annotation-39) of the people who interacted with it

Partners who advertise with us also receive other information. [Read our policy](#4.subpage.2-AdvertisersAndAudienceNetwork) about how we share information with advertisers.

Partners who offer goods or services on our Products and commerce services platforms
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you choose to [make a transaction\[41\]](#annotation-41), or otherwise choose to share information with a seller, creator, fundraiser, charity, payment services provider or [commerce services platform\[42\]](#annotation-42), we share information with them and with any providers acting on their behalf.

Depending on how you interact with them, they receive:

* Information to complete your transaction, like order, payment, contact and shipping information
* Information to help ensure the security of the transaction, like information about your device or connection
* Any information required by applicable regulation
* Other information you choose to share with them

For example, if you make a purchase from an Instagram shop using checkout, the shop will receive information to complete your transaction. This may include your order items, your contact details and shipping information. If the shop uses a payment services provider, such as PayPal, to facilitate the transaction, the provider will receive the transaction amount, a transaction description (to appear on your credit card statement) and your payment card information, such as cardholder name, card number, expiration date and billing address. [Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/357872324807367/) about payments on Instagram.

Integrated Partners
-------------------

When you choose to use Integrated Partners’ products or services, they receive information about you and your activity. [Read the policy](#3.subpage.4-WhenYouUseAn).

Vendors
-------

Measurement and marketing vendors
---------------------------------

Measurement and marketing vendors are businesses that provide marketing-related support to Meta and its advertisers. For example, they purchase ads on our behalf, provide market research and measure the effectiveness of our campaigns. Such vendors also support our Partners' advertising.

Measurement vendors
-------------------

We don’t create every measurement and analytics report ourselves.

We work with measurement vendors who create reports that help our Partners, like advertisers, understand how their content and ads are performing, who is engaging with them and whether people took an action after seeing their ad.

We share information (like whether people saw an ad or engaged with it) with our measurement vendors, who aggregate it to provide their reports. [See an example\[43\]](#annotation-43).

Marketing vendors
-----------------

We share information about you with companies that help market our Company and Products, measure the effectiveness of our own marketing campaigns and perform advertising research. For example, we share your device identifier or other identifiers with advertising vendors to help us serve you ads most relevant to your interests. [Learn more\[44\]](#annotation-44) about how vendors support our marketing and advertising efforts.

Service providers provide services to us that help us provide our Products to you. We share the information we have about you to receive these services, which include:

* Investigating suspicious activity
* Detecting and stopping threats to our personnel and property
* Facilitating payments
* Providing customer support
* Improving the functionality of our Products
* Providing technical infrastructure services
* Analyzing how our Products are used
* Conducting research and surveys
* Marketing and promoting our Products
* Analyzing the effectiveness of our ads

Third parties
-------------

External researchers
--------------------

We provide information to external researchers. They use it to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation, and to promote safety, security and integrity.

Research goals include supporting:

* Our business or mission
* Social good. [Learn more](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/).
* Technological advancement
* Safety and security on our Products
* Public interest
* Health and well-being

When sharing data with external researchers, we ensure the privacy of our users is protected. [Learn more](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Flm.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fresearch.fb.com%2Fdata%2F) about the privacy-safe research we support.

Other times we share with third parties
---------------------------------------

We also share information with third parties in response to legal requests, to comply with applicable law or to prevent harm. [Read the policy](#10-HowDoWeRespond).

And if we sell or transfer all or part of our business to someone else, then we may give the new owner your information as part of that transaction, in line with applicable law.

39

General demographics and interests
----------------------------------

For example, a bike shop creates a Page on Facebook and wants to place an ad to reach an audience of people in Atlanta interested in cycling. We determine whether someone fits in this audience based on, for example, whether they liked a Page about bikes. Then people in that audience could see the bike shop's ad.

You can see the “interests” assigned to you in your [ad preferences](https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/) and remove them if you want.

The bike shop can then see reports showing aggregated statistics about the audience seeing their ads and how their ads are performing. The reports would show statistics to the advertiser that, for example, most of the people who saw or clicked on their ad:

* Were women
* Were between the ages of 25 and 34
* Clicked on the ad from their phone

40

When you might give us permission
---------------------------------

For example, you might request more information from a business by clicking their ad in your Facebook Feed and submitting a form with your name and contact information. Then the advertiser would receive the information you provided.

41

Transactions you might make
---------------------------

* Subscribing to premium content
* Buying, selling or using products
* Buying, selling or using services
* Donating to charities

42

Commerce services platforms
---------------------------

Commerce services platforms provide a range of commerce services, including:

* Payments
* Marketing
* Shipping
* Customer engagement tools

43

How measurement vendors use information to make reports
-------------------------------------------------------

For example, an advertiser might ask a measurement vendor to help figure out the impact its ads on Facebook have had on sales. The measurement vendor compares information from us about clicks on the advertiser’s Facebook ads with information from the advertiser about product purchases. Then the measurement vendor creates and provides aggregated reports that show the advertiser how its ads are performing.

44

How vendors support our marketing and advertising efforts
---------------------------------------------------------

For example, vendors:

* Serve our advertisements across the Internet, including on mobile, desktop and connected television devices
* Track and categorize your online and mobile app activity
* Provide us information about your interests and community and advertising interactions

These vendors help us understand who might find our advertising most relevant to their interests, and which of our Products might interest you. This information can be used to personalize which of our ads are shown to you. Vendors also use this information to measure response to our marketing efforts and the effectiveness of our advertising.

Please note that once your [account is permanently deleted](https://www.facebook.com/help/250563911970368/?helpref=hc_fnav), you won’t be able to reactivate it, and you won’t be able to retrieve information you’ve added, including content you’ve posted.

How long do we keep your information?
=====================================

We keep information as long as we need it to provide our Products, comply with legal obligations or protect our or other’s interests. We decide how long we need information on a case-by-case basis. Here’s what we consider when we decide:

* If we need it to operate or provide our Products. For example, we need to keep some of your information to maintain your account. [Learn more\[46\]](#annotation-46).
* The feature we use it for, and how that feature works. For example, messages sent using Messenger’s vanish mode are retained for less time than regular messages. [Learn more\[47\]](#annotation-47).
* How long we need to retain the information to comply with certain legal obligations. [See some examples\[48\]](#annotation-48).
* If we need it for other legitimate purposes, such as to prevent harm; investigate possible violations of our terms or policies; promote safety, security and integrity; or protect ourselves, including our rights, property or products

In some instances and for specific reasons, we’ll keep information for an extended period of time. [Read our policy\[49\]](#annotation-49) about when we may preserve your information.

46

If we need it to operate or provide our Products
------------------------------------------------

For example, we keep profile information, photos you’ve posted (and not deleted) and security information for the lifetime of your account.

And when you search for something on Facebook, we keep your search history until you clear the search in your [activity log](https://www.facebook.com/0/allactivity) or delete your account. Once you clear a search or delete your account, it will no longer be visible to you, and it will be [deleted\[50\]](#annotation-50).

But even if you don’t clear your search or delete your account, within six months of your search we delete information about that search that isn’t necessary to show you your search history, like information about the device you were using, or your location.

47

The feature we use it for, and how that feature works
-----------------------------------------------------

For example, May is planning a surprise party for Yang. She sends Cynthia the party details in Messenger using vanish mode so that the message will disappear. The message will no longer be visible to May once she leaves the chat, and Cynthia will see the message only the first time she opens the chat thread.

After Cynthia reads the message, the content is deleted after one hour. If Cynthia never reads it, it’s deleted after 14 days.

48

How long we need to retain the information to comply with certain legal obligations
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For example, we retain information for as long as we need it for:

* A legal request or obligation, including obligations of Meta Companies or to comply with applicable law
* A governmental investigation
* A legal claim, complaint, litigation or regulatory proceedings

49

Why we may preserve your information longer
-------------------------------------------

Your information, including financial transaction data related to purchases or money transfers made on our Products, may be preserved and accessed for a longer time period if it’s related to any of the following:

* A legal request or obligation, including obligations of Meta Companies or to comply with applicable law
* A governmental investigation
* An investigation of possible violations of our terms or policies
* To prevent harm
* For safety, security and integrity purposes
* To protect ourselves, including our rights, property or products
* If it’s needed in relation to a legal claim, complaint, litigation or regulatory proceedings

[See some examples\[51\]](#annotation-51).

In some cases, we may preserve your information based on the above reasons even after you request deletion of your account or some of your content. We may also preserve information from accounts that have been disabled and content that has been removed for violations of our terms and policies.

50

Delete your information or account
----------------------------------

To delete your information, you can:

* **Find and delete specific information.** We offer tools you can use to delete certain information. For example, you can use Delete buttons to delete content you’ve posted to your account. You can also use tools like [activity log](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Flm.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.fb.com%2Fnews%2F2020%2F06%2Fintroducing-manage-activity%2F) on Facebook to send content to the trash in bulk.

--------------------------------------------------

### To respond to a legal request

For example, we might preserve your information after you delete your account when we receive a valid legal request, such as a preservation order or search warrant, related to your account.

### To comply with applicable law

For example, we preserve certain information about purchases or transactions associated with an account, in line with Meta’s accounting obligations.

### For safety, security and integrity purposes

For example, if we disable an account for violating our terms or policies, we preserve information about that user to prevent them from opening a new account.

We also might preserve some of your account information as part of our review of suspicious activity. This includes any suspicious activity associated with our financial products, like suspected money laundering or terrorist funding.

### For litigation

We may preserve your information where we deem it necessary for reasons related to a legal claim or complaint. For example, we may be required to defend ourselves in legal proceedings in a claim related to your information.

How do we transfer information?
===============================

Why is information transferred to other countries?
--------------------------------------------------

We share the [information we collect](#1-WhatInformationDoWe) globally, both internally across our offices and data centers, and externally with our Partners, vendors, service providers and third parties. Because Meta is global, with users, Partners and employees around the world, transfers are necessary for a variety of reasons, including:

* So we can operate and provide the services stated in the terms of the Meta Product you’re using and this Policy. This includes allowing you to share information and connect with your family and friends around the globe.
* So we can fix, analyze and improve our Products

Where is information transferred?
---------------------------------

Information controlled by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited will be transferred or transmitted to, or stored and processed in:

* Places we have infrastructure or data centers, including the United States, Ireland, Denmark and Sweden, among others
* Countries where Meta Company Products are available
* Other countries where our Partners, vendors, service providers and third parties are located outside of the country where you live, for purposes as described in this Policy

How do we safeguard your information?
-------------------------------------

We rely on [appropriate mechanisms\[52\]](#annotation-52) for international data transfers.

We also make sure that appropriate safeguards are in place whenever we transfer your information. For example, we encrypt your information when it’s in transit over public networks to protect it from unauthorized access.

52

Mechanisms we use for global data transfers
-------------------------------------------

We rely on appropriate mechanisms for international data transfers. For example, for [information we collect](#1-WhatInformationDoWe):

* We rely on decisions from the European Commission by which they recognise that certain countries and territories outside of the European Economic Area ensure [an adequate level of protection](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Flm.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fec.europa.eu%2Finfo%2Flaw%2Flaw-topic%2Fdata-protection%2Finternational-dimension-data-protection%2Fadequacy-decisions_en) for personal data. These decisions are referred to as “adequacy decisions.” We transfer the [information we collect](#1-WhatInformationDoWe) from the European Economic Area to Argentina, Israel, New Zealand, Switzerland and, where the decision is applicable, Canada in reliance on an adequacy decision. [Learn more\[53\]](#annotation-53) about the adequacy decision for each country.
* In other circumstances, we rely on [standard contractual clauses](https://www.facebook.com/help/566994660333381?ref=dp) approved by the European Commission (and the equivalent standard contractual clauses for the UK, where appropriate) or on derogations provided for under applicable law to transfer information to a third country. For example, there is currently no adequacy decision in respect of the United States, so we rely on standard contractual clauses when transferring data to Meta Platforms, Inc.
* In addition to the standard contractual clauses, we also apply [supplemental measures](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Flm.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.fb.com%2Fnews%2F2021%2F03%2Fsteps-we-take-to-transfer-data-securely%2F) to ensure equivalent protection of your data when transferred.

How do we respond to legal requests, comply with applicable law and prevent harm?
=================================================================================

We access, preserve, use and share your information:

We respond to legal requests where we have a good faith belief that we’re required by law to do so.

We also respond to certain legal requests where not compelled by law, but where we have a good faith belief that a response:

* Is required by law in that jurisdiction,
* Affects users in that jurisdiction, and
* Is consistent with internationally recognized standards including, for example, our [Corporate Human Rights Policy](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Flm.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.fb.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2021%2F04%2FFacebooks-Corporate-Human-Rights-Policy.pdf).

How we promote safety, security and integrity
---------------------------------------------

We share your information with law enforcement, government authorities, Meta Companies, third parties (including industry peers) and others when we have a good faith belief it’s necessary to detect, prevent and address a variety of situations, such as:

* Preventing abuse, fraud, or other harmful or illegal activity, on and off our Products
* Protecting you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries
* Emergency situations, such as risk of death or imminent bodily harm

56

Why we may preserve your information longer
-------------------------------------------

Your information, including financial transaction data related to purchases or money transfers made on our Products, may be preserved and accessed for a longer time period if it’s related to any of the following:

* A legal request or obligation, including obligations of Meta Companies or to comply with applicable law
* A governmental investigation
* An investigation of possible violations of our terms or policies
* To prevent harm
* For safety, security and integrity purposes
* To protect ourselves, including our rights, property or products
* If it’s needed in relation to a legal claim, complaint, litigation or regulatory proceedings

[See some examples\[59\]](#annotation-59).

In some cases, we may preserve your information based on the above reasons even after you request deletion of your account or some of your content. We may also preserve information from accounts that have been disabled and content that has been removed for violations of our terms and policies.

57

Unauthorized use of our Products
--------------------------------

For example, if you unlawfully collect and use Facebook user data, we may share your information to defend ourselves against claims or in litigation.

58

Violations of our terms and policies
------------------------------------

For example, if you post threatening or harmful content, we may share your information across the Meta Companies to protect ourselves and others. This can include blocking your access to certain features or disabling your account across the Meta Companies.

59

Examples of why we might preserve your information
--------------------------------------------------

### To respond to a legal request

For example, we might preserve your information after you delete your account when we receive a valid legal request, such as a preservation order or search warrant, related to your account.

### To comply with applicable law

For example, we preserve certain information about purchases or transactions associated with an account, in line with Meta’s accounting obligations.

### For safety, security and integrity purposes

For example, if we disable an account for violating our terms or policies, we preserve information about that user to prevent them from opening a new account.

We also might preserve some of your account information as part of our review of suspicious activity. This includes any suspicious activity associated with our financial products, like suspected money laundering or terrorist funding.

### For litigation

We may preserve your information where we deem it necessary for reasons related to a legal claim or complaint. For example, we may be required to defend ourselves in legal proceedings in a claim related to your information.
