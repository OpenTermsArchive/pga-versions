But in some cases, we also use [manual review](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?annotations%5B0%5D=2.ex.2-ManualReviewExamplesOf&back_id=ref-23&entry=0) to access and review your information.

To use less information that’s connected to individual users, in some cases we de-identify or aggregate information. We might also anonymize it so that it no longer identifies you. We use this information in the same ways we use your information as described in this section.

Here are the ways we use your information:

You can choose to connect with [Integrated Partners](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?annotations%5B0%5D=1.ex.37-OurPartnersBusinessesAnd&back_id=ref-33&entry=0) who use our Products. If you do, these Integrated Partners receive information about you and your activity.

These Integrated Partners can always access information that’s public on our Products. Learn more about other information they receive and how they handle your information:

When you use an Integrated Partner’s product or service
-------------------------------------------------------

Information they receive automatically
--------------------------------------

When you use an Integrated Partner’s products or services, they can access:

*   What you post or share from these products or services
*   What you use their services to do
*   Information from and about the device you’re using

[See examples](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?annotations%5B0%5D=3.story.3-WhenAnIntegratedPartner&back_id=ref-34&entry=0) of when an Integrated Partner might receive your information.

Information they receive with your permission
---------------------------------------------

Sometimes these Integrated Partners ask you for permission to access certain additional information from your Facebook, Instagram or Messenger account. In their request, they’ll explain what information they’d like to access and let you choose whether to share it.

On Facebook, this includes things like your email address, hometown or birthday. On Instagram, this includes content, like photos and videos, that you’ve shared from your account when the account was set to private.

[Learn what happens if you choose to share your friends list, or if your friends choose to share their friends list.](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?annotations%5B0%5D=3.ex.8-SharingFriendsListsWhen&back_id=ref-35&entry=0)

We automatically log when you receive a request from an Integrated Partner to access your information. These requests to access information are separate from the Apps and Websites access that you manage in your Facebook or Instagram ad settings or in your mobile device settings.

How long they can access your information
-----------------------------------------

Apps or websites you’ve logged into using Facebook Login or connected to your Instagram account can access your nonpublic information on Meta Products unless it appears to us that you haven’t used the app or website in 90 days. Note that even if an app’s access to your data has expired, it can still retain information you shared with it previously.

We encourage you to visit your [Apps and Websites settings](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/logging/?target=POLICY_PLATFORM_LINK_COLLECTION%3AMANAGE_APPS&element=privacy_policy_inline_text&containing_element_id=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A3.subpage.4-WhenYouUseAn&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmbasic.facebook.com%2Fprivacy%2Fpolicy%2Fprintable%2F%3Fback_id%3Dlink-collection-5%26link_dialog%3DMANAGE_APPS%26entry%3D0) from time to time to review which apps and websites continue to have access to your information through Facebook Login or Instagram.

How do we share information with Partners, vendors, service providers and third parties?
========================================================================================

We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and we never will. We also require Partners and third parties to follow rules about how they can and cannot use and disclose the information we provide.

Here’s more detail about who we share information with:

Partners
--------

Advertisers and Audience Network publishers
-------------------------------------------

### Advertisers

We provide advertisers with reports about the number and kinds of people who see and engage with their ads. These reports include information about the general demographics and interests of people who engaged with an advertiser’s ad. Then advertisers can better understand their audience. [See an example](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?annotations%5B0%5D=4.ex.4-GeneralDemographicsAndInterests&back_id=ref-36&entry=0).

Meta also provides advertisers and their business partners with information about:

*   Ads people engaged with, if any
*   When people engaged with ads
*   Where that ad was shown (for example, on Instagram, or on Facebook)

But we don't share information with these advertisers and their business partners that by itself can be used to contact or identify you, such as your name or email address, unless you [give us permission.](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?annotations%5B0%5D=4.ex.8-WhenYouMightGive&back_id=ref-37&entry=0)

### Audience Network publishers and their business partners

Meta Audience Network lets advertisers place ads with us that will be published on apps outside of Meta.

To help show you ads on their apps, we share information with publishers who use Audience Network, as well as business partners who facilitate that use. For example, we share:

*   How many people see and engage with ads on publisher apps
*   Information related to or in response to a [publisher’s request](https://www.facebook.com/help/119468292028768?ref=shareable) to serve an ad on its app.

But we don't share information with these publishers and their business partners that by itself can be used to contact or identify you, such as your name or email address, unless you [give us permission](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?annotations%5B0%5D=4.ex.8-WhenYouMightGive&back_id=ref-38&entry=0).

Partners who use our analytics services
---------------------------------------

People rely on our Products, like business accounts, professional tools and Facebook Pages, to run and promote their businesses. Businesses use our analytics services to understand more about how people are using their content and features.

We receive information about how people interact with their posts, listings, Facebook Pages, videos, Shops or other content, on and off our Products. Then we put this information into aggregate reports so they can see how well their content is performing.

These reports aggregate information like:

*   How many people interacted with their content
*   [The general demographics and interests](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?annotations%5B0%5D=4.ex.4-GeneralDemographicsAndInterests&back_id=ref-39&entry=0) of the people who interacted with it

Partners who advertise with us also receive other information. [Read our policy](#4.subpage.2-AdvertisersAndAudienceNetwork) about how we share information with advertisers.

Partners who offer goods or services on our Products and commerce services platforms
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you choose to [make a transaction](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?annotations%5B0%5D=4.ex.19-TransactionsYouMightMake&back_id=ref-40&entry=0), or otherwise choose to share information with a seller, creator, fundraiser, charity, payment services provider or [commerce services platform](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?annotations%5B0%5D=4.ex.22-CommerceServicesPlatformsCommerce&back_id=ref-41&entry=0), we share information with them and with any providers acting on their behalf.

Depending on how you interact with them, they receive:

*   Information to complete your transaction, like order, payment, contact and shipping information
*   Information to help ensure the security of the transaction, like information about your device or connection
*   Any information required by applicable regulation
*   Other information you choose to share with them

For example, if you make a purchase from an Instagram shop using checkout, the shop will receive information to complete your transaction. This may include your order items, your contact details and shipping information. If the shop uses a payment services provider, such as PayPal, to facilitate the transaction, the provider will receive the transaction amount, a transaction description (to appear on your credit card statement) and your payment card information, such as cardholder name, card number, expiration date and billing address. [Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/357872324807367/) about payments on Instagram.

Integrated Partners
-------------------

When you choose to use Integrated Partners’ products or services, they receive information about you and your activity. [Read the policy](#3.subpage.4-WhenYouUseAn).

Vendors
-------

Measurement and marketing vendors
---------------------------------

Measurement and marketing vendors are businesses that provide marketing-related support to Meta and its advertisers. For example, they purchase ads on our behalf, provide market research and measure the effectiveness of our campaigns. Such vendors also support our Partners' advertising.

Measurement vendors
-------------------

We don’t create every measurement and analytics report ourselves.

We work with measurement vendors who create reports that help our Partners, like advertisers, understand how their content and ads are performing, who is engaging with them and whether people took an action after seeing their ad.

We share information (like whether people saw an ad or engaged with it) with our measurement vendors, who aggregate it to provide their reports. [See an example](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?annotations%5B0%5D=4.ex.12-HowMeasurementVendorsUse&back_id=ref-42&entry=0).

Marketing vendors
-----------------

We share information about you with companies that help market our Company and Products, measure the effectiveness of our own marketing campaigns and perform advertising research. For example, we share your device identifier or other identifiers with advertising vendors to help us serve you ads most relevant to your interests. [Learn more](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?annotations%5B0%5D=4.ex.16-HowVendorsSupportOur&back_id=ref-43&entry=0) about how vendors support our marketing and advertising efforts.

Service providers
-----------------

Service providers
-----------------

Service providers provide services to us that help us provide our Products to you. We share the information we have about you to receive these services, which include:

*   Investigating suspicious activity
*   Detecting and stopping threats to our personnel and property
*   Facilitating payments
*   Providing customer support
*   Improving the functionality of our Products
*   Providing technical infrastructure services
*   Analyzing how our Products are used
*   Conducting research and surveys
*   Marketing and promoting our Products
*   Analyzing the effectiveness of our ads

Third parties
-------------

External researchers
--------------------

We provide information to external researchers. They use it to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation, and to promote safety, security and integrity.

Research goals include supporting:

*   Our business or mission
*   Social good. [Learn more](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/).
*   Technological advancement
*   Safety and security on our Products
*   Public interest
*   Health and well-being

When sharing data with external researchers, we ensure the privacy of our users is protected. [Learn more](https://lm.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fresearch.fb.com%2Fdata%2F&h=AT07GTQyan3p77CUwS37WcLvW0VnBUQmjPQEAkvj2tr4fGtgKVvqnXDTszJGCGSyT0nLD0cRkXZM3iU1Jd4SGJnbmr2NaL4TFR8pkRDA6sHr8IVZ5AA8-9JzhcBtp8vcsaH4sG_3bVJtUN6t) about the privacy-safe research we support.

Other times we share with third parties
---------------------------------------

We also share information with third parties in response to legal requests, to comply with applicable law or to prevent harm. [Read the policy](#10-HowDoWeRespond).

And if we sell or transfer all or part of our business to someone else, then we may give the new owner your information as part of that transaction, in line with applicable law.

How do the Meta Companies work together?
========================================

We are part of the [Meta Companies](https://www.facebook.com/help/111814505650678) that provide Meta Company Products. [Meta Company Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/195227921252400) include all the Meta Products covered by this Policy, plus other products like WhatsApp, Novi and more.

We share information we collect, infrastructure, systems and technology with the other Meta Companies. [Learn more](#9-HowDoWeTransfer) about how we transfer information to other countries.

We also process information that we receive about you from other Meta Companies, according to their terms and policies and as permitted by applicable law. In some cases, Meta acts as a service provider for other Meta Companies. We act on their behalf and in accordance with their instructions and terms.

Why we share across the Meta Companies
--------------------------------------

Meta Products share information with other Meta Companies:

*   To promote safety, security and integrity and comply with applicable laws
*   To personalize offers, ads and other sponsored or commercial content
*   To develop and provide features and integrations
*   To understand how people use and interact with Meta Company Products

[See some examples](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?annotations%5B0%5D=5.ex.2-WhyWeShareAcross&back_id=ref-44&entry=0) of why we share.

How long do we keep your information?
=====================================

We keep information as long as we need it to provide our Products, comply with legal obligations or protect our or other’s interests. We decide how long we need information on a case-by-case basis. Here’s what we consider when we decide:

*   If we need it to operate or provide our Products. For example, we need to keep some of your information to maintain your account. [Learn more](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?annotations%5B0%5D=8.ex.1-IfWeNeedIt&back_id=ref-45&entry=0).
*   The feature we use it for, and how that feature works. For example, messages sent using Messenger’s vanish mode are retained for less time than regular messages. [Learn more](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?annotations%5B0%5D=8.story.1-TheFeatureWeUse&back_id=ref-46&entry=0).
*   How long we need to retain the information to comply with certain legal obligations. [See some examples](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?annotations%5B0%5D=8.ex.2-HowLongWeNeed&back_id=ref-47&entry=0).
*   If we need it for other legitimate purposes, such as to prevent harm; investigate possible violations of our terms or policies; promote safety, security and integrity; or protect ourselves, including our rights, property or products

In some instances and for specific reasons, we’ll keep information for an extended period of time. [Read our policy](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?annotations%5B0%5D=8.ex.3-WhyWeMayPreserve&back_id=ref-48&entry=0) about when we may preserve your information.

How do we transfer information?
===============================

Why is information transferred to other countries?
--------------------------------------------------

We share the [information we collect](#1-WhatInformationDoWe) globally, both internally across our offices and data centers, and externally with our Partners, vendors, service providers and third parties. Because Meta is global, with users, Partners and employees around the world, transfers are necessary for a variety of reasons, including:

*   So we can operate and provide the services stated in the terms of the Meta Product you’re using and this Policy. This includes allowing you to share information and connect with your family and friends around the globe.
*   So we can fix, analyze and improve our Products

Where is information transferred?
---------------------------------

Information controlled by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited will be transferred or transmitted to, or stored and processed in:

*   Places we have infrastructure or data centers, including the United States, Ireland, Denmark and Sweden, among others
*   Countries where Meta Company Products are available
*   Other countries where our Partners, vendors, service providers and third parties are located outside of the country where you live, for purposes as described in this Policy

How do we safeguard your information?
-------------------------------------

We rely on [appropriate mechanisms](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?annotations%5B0%5D=9.ex.2-MechanismsWeUseFor&back_id=ref-49&entry=0) for international data transfers.

We also make sure that appropriate safeguards are in place whenever we transfer your information. For example, we encrypt your information when it’s in transit over public networks to protect it from unauthorized access.
