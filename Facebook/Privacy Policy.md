This includes what you click on or like, your posts and photos, your chats with [AI at Meta](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/genai?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A1-WhatInformationDoWe), and messages you send. On some Products, you can use end-to-end encrypted messages.

The information we collect and process about you depends on how you use our [Products\[3\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A1-WhatInformationDoWe#annotation-3).

*   We take into account whether your friends belong to a group when we suggest you join it.

How do we use your information?
===============================

Highlights
----------

Here are some of the ways we use your information:

*   We personalize your experience, like by suggesting reels to watch, communities to join or providing more relevant responses from [AI at Meta](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/genai?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A2-HowDoWeUse)
*   We improve our Products by applying information about what you use them to do, and what else is happening on your device when our app crashes
*   We work to prevent harmful behavior and keep people safe on our Products

We use [information we collect](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A2-HowDoWeUse#1-WhatInformationDoWe) to provide a personalized experience to you, including ads (if we show you ads), along with the other purposes we explain in detail below.

For some of these purposes, we use information [across Meta Company Products\[26\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A2-HowDoWeUse#annotation-26) from the accounts you choose to add to your Accounts Center, and [across your devices\[27\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A2-HowDoWeUse#annotation-27).

But in some cases, we also use [manual review\[28\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A2-HowDoWeUse#annotation-28) to access and review your information.

To use less information that’s connected to individual users, in some cases we de-identify or aggregate information or anonymize it so that it no longer identifies you. We use this information in the same ways we use your information as described in this section.

Here are the ways we use your information:

We use [information with special protections](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBSECTION%3A2.1-ToProvidePersonalizeAnd#1.subpage.1-YourActivityAndInformation) you choose to provide for these purposes, but not to show you ads.

To provide our Products for free, we use your information to show you ads, which advertisers, businesses, organizations and others pay us to show you. We want everything you see to be interesting and useful to you, so we personalize ads for you and measure how they perform. We use information from your account or across accounts in your Accounts Center and cookies on our Products for this. You can control whether we show you ads and which information we use to show you ads in [Ad Preferences](https://accountscenter.facebook.com/ad_preferences?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A2.subpage.2-HowWeShowAds).

How is your information shared on Meta Products or with integrated partners?
============================================================================

Highlights
----------

*   You can choose to share information on our Products or with integrated partners
*   Remember to share only with people you trust
*   You might decide to use a product that integrates with one of ours, like if you use Facebook Login to log into a music service or a shopping site
*   If you do, that organization will ask you to receive some information about you, like your email address or birthday

Learn more about the different cases when your information can be shared on our [Products\[41\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A3-HowIsYourInformation#annotation-41):

People and accounts you share and communicate with
--------------------------------------------------

When you share and communicate using our Products, you can sometimes [choose the audience\[42\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A3.subpage.1-PeopleAndAccountsYou#annotation-42) for what you share.

When you interact with people or businesses, they can see:

For example, the audience you choose can see when you:

*   Share a post you’ve written
*   Share a photo or video
*   Create a story
*   Share a news article
*   Add information to your profile

People you interact with can see what you send to them. So if you send a person or a business a message on Messenger or Instagram, that person or business can read your message.

People and businesses can also see some of your activity on our Products. This includes when you:

*   Comment on or react to others’ posts
*   Engage with ads or other sponsored or commercial content, like by commenting or liking
*   Allow content you've shared about a product in a Shop to be shared across our Products
*   View their story on Facebook or Instagram
*   Connect a new Meta device, like smart glasses, to your account

Some of our Products might provide you with settings that allow others to see when you're active on our Products, such as “active status.” In some cases, we also offer settings that allow others to see when you’re active in a particular section of one of our Products, like a message thread, game or event, or when you last used one of our Products.

Learn how to update your Active Status on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/help/215888465102253?helpref=faq_content&entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A3.subpage.1-PeopleAndAccountsYou) and [Messenger](https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/278118979024443?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A3.subpage.1-PeopleAndAccountsYou), or how to update your Activity Status on [Instagram](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Flm.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F1164377657035425%3Fentry_point%3DPOLICY_SUBPAGE%253A3.subpage.1-PeopleAndAccountsYou).

Some accounts are [supervised\[43\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A3.subpage.1-PeopleAndAccountsYou#annotation-43). When you interact with a supervised user, their parent or guardian can see some of your activity and information. This can include information like your username, profile picture and if the supervised user blocked you. On some Products, the supervised user can let their parent or guardian know if they reported you.

Content others share or reshare about you
-----------------------------------------

People in your audience can view your content and can choose to share it with others outside your audience, on and off our Products. For example, when you share a post or send a message to specific friends, they can download, screenshot or reshare it with anyone, on, across or off our Products.

When you comment on a post or react to a photo, your comment or reaction can be seen by anyone who can see the post or photo. This can include people you aren’t connected to. The person who shared the post can also change their audience at any time after you’ve interacted with it.

When others interact with [AI at Meta](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/genai?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A3.subpage.2-ContentOthersShareOr), they can share information about you, including [messages and content you have shared\[44\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A3.subpage.2-ContentOthersShareOr#annotation-44).

People who use our Products can share information about you with the audience they choose. For example, they can:

*   Share a photo or video of you in a post, comment, story, reel or message
*   Mention you in a post or story
*   Tag you in a post, comment, story or location
*   Share details about you in a post, story or message

If you’re uncomfortable with what others have shared about you on our Products, for example on Facebook, you can always choose to [report posts and stories](https://www.facebook.com/help/1380418588640631?ref=dp&entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A3.subpage.2-ContentOthersShareOr).

Public content
--------------

Some of your information and activity are always public. This includes your:

*   Name
*   Facebook and Instagram username
*   Profile picture
*   Activity on public groups, Facebook Pages and channels
*   Activity on content that is public. For example, your comment, rating or review on Marketplace, or on a public Instagram account.

Other content you can choose to set to Public, like posts, photos and videos you post to your profile, Stories or Reels.

When content is public, it can be seen by anyone on or across our Products, and in some cases off our Products, even if they don’t have an account.

For example, if you comment on Marketplace, a Facebook Page or a public Instagram account, or if you leave a rating or review, your comment, rating or review will be visible to anyone. It could appear in any of our Products or be seen by anyone, including off our Products.

We, you and people using our Products can send public content (like your profile photo, or information you share on a Facebook Page or public Instagram account) to anyone on, across or off our Products. For example, users can share it in a public forum, or it can appear in search results on the internet or our [research tools](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Flm.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Fresearchtools%2Fmeta-content-library%3Fentry_point%3DPOLICY_SUBPAGE%253A3.subpage.3-PublicContentWhatContent).

Public content can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through third-party services, like:

*   [APIs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A3.subpage.3-PublicContentWhatContent)
*   The media, like TV
*   Other apps and websites connected to our Products
*   Search engines. [Learn more\[45\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A3.subpage.3-PublicContentWhatContent#annotation-45).

Search engines and other third parties use this information according to their own terms and policies, not Meta’s.

You can choose to connect with [integrated partners\[46\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBSECTION%3A3.2-WithIntegratedPartnersYou#annotation-46) who use our Products. If you do, these integrated partners receive information about you and your activity.

These integrated partners can always access information that’s public on our Products. Learn more about other information they receive and how they handle your information:

When you use an integrated partner’s product or service
-------------------------------------------------------

When you use an integrated partner’s products or services, they can access:

*   What you post or share from these products or services
*   What you use their services to do
*   Information from and about the device you’re using
*   The language setting you’ve chosen on our Products

[See examples\[47\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A3.subpage.4-WhenYouUseAn#annotation-47) of when an integrated partner might receive your information.

Sometimes these integrated partners ask you for permission to access certain additional information from your Facebook, Instagram or Messenger account. In their request, they’ll explain what information they’d like to access and let you choose whether to share it.

On Facebook, this includes things like your email address, hometown or birthday. On Instagram, this includes content, like photos and videos, that you’ve shared from your account when the account was set to private.

[Learn what happens if you choose to share your friends list, or if your friends choose to share their friends list.\[48\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A3.subpage.4-WhenYouUseAn#annotation-48)

We automatically log when you receive a request from an integrated partner to access your information. These requests to access information are separate from the Apps and Websites access that you manage in your Facebook or Instagram Ad settings or in your mobile device settings.

Apps or websites you’ve logged into using Facebook Login or connected to your Instagram account can access your nonpublic information on Meta Products unless it appears to us that you haven’t used the app or website in 90 days. Note that even if an app’s access to your information has expired, it can still retain information you shared with it previously.

We encourage you to visit your Apps and Websites settings from time to time to review which apps and websites continue to have access to your information through Facebook Login or Instagram.

When you interact with someone else’s content on an integrated partner’s product or service
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Integrated partners receive information about your activity when you interact with other Facebook, Instagram or Messenger users while they’re using the integrated partner’s product or service.

For example, a gamer livestreams to Facebook using a partner app. Then you comment on that livestream. The app developer will receive information about your comment.

How integrated partners handle your information
-----------------------------------------------

Integrated partners handle the information you share with them according to their own terms and policies, not Meta’s. You can review their privacy policy on their website or app to learn how they receive and process your information. In some cases, they use a separate service provider to receive and process your information.

How do we share information with third parties?
===============================================

Highlights
----------

We share certain information with:

*   Advertisers who show ads on our Products
*   Businesses we hire to market our Products for us
*   Businesses we hire to do things like offer customer service or conduct surveys
*   Researchers who use it to do things like innovate, advance technology, or improve people’s safety

We don’t sell your information, and we never will.

We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and we never will. We also require [partners\[49\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A4-HowDoWeShare#annotation-49) and other [third parties\[50\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A4-HowDoWeShare#annotation-50) to follow rules about how they can and cannot use and disclose the information we provide.

Here’s more detail about who we share information with:

Advertisers and Audience Network publishers (if we show you ads)
----------------------------------------------------------------

### Advertisers

We provide advertisers with reports about the number and kinds of people who see and engage with their ads. These reports include information about the general demographics and interests of people who engaged with an advertiser’s ad. Then advertisers can better understand their audience. [See an example\[51\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.2-AdvertisersAndAudienceNetwork#annotation-51).

Meta also provides advertisers and their vendors with information about:

*   Ads people engaged with, if any
*   When people engaged with ads
*   Where that ad was shown (for example, on Instagram, or on Facebook)

We also confirm which ads you viewed that led you to take an action with an advertiser, such as downloading an advertiser's app. But we don't share information with these advertisers and their vendors that by itself can be used to contact or identify you, such as your name or email address, unless you [give us permission.\[52\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.2-AdvertisersAndAudienceNetwork#annotation-52)

### Audience Network publishers and their vendors

Meta Audience Network lets advertisers place ads with us that will be published on other apps and websites outside of Meta.

To help show you ads on their apps and websites, we share information with publishers who use Audience Network, as well as vendors who facilitate that use. For example, we share:

*   How many people see and engage with ads on publisher apps
*   Information related to or in response to a [publisher’s request](https://www.facebook.com/help/119468292028768?ref=shareable&entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.2-AdvertisersAndAudienceNetwork) to serve an ad on its app.

But we don't share information with these publishers and their vendors that by itself can be used to contact or identify you, such as your name or email address, unless you [give us permission\[52\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.2-AdvertisersAndAudienceNetwork#annotation-52).

Partners who use our analytics services
---------------------------------------

People rely on our [Products\[53\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.4-PartnersWhoUseOur#annotation-53), like business accounts, professional tools and Facebook Pages, to run and promote their businesses. Businesses use our analytics services to understand more about how people are using their content, features, products and services.

To provide these services, we use the [information we collect](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.4-PartnersWhoUseOur#1-WhatInformationDoWe) about you. We put this information into aggregate reports so that partners can see how well their content, features, products and services are performing and are able to understand things like users’ experience with such content, products and services.

These reports aggregate information like:

*   How many people interacted with our partners' content, products or services
*   The [general demographics and interests\[51\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.4-PartnersWhoUseOur#annotation-51) of the people who interacted with it
*   How people use our partners’ products and services to connect to Meta Products and the performance of their connection and networks

Advertisers also receive other information. [Read our Policy](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.4-PartnersWhoUseOur#4.subpage.2-AdvertisersAndAudienceNetwork) about how we share information with advertisers.

Partners who offer goods or services on our Products and commerce services platforms
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you choose to [make a transaction\[54\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.6-PartnersWhoOfferGoods#annotation-54), or otherwise choose to share information with a seller, creator, fundraiser, charity, payment services provider or [commerce services platform\[55\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.6-PartnersWhoOfferGoods#annotation-55), we share information with them and with any providers acting on their behalf.

Depending on how you interact with them, they receive:

*   Information to complete your transaction, like order, payment, contact and shipping information
*   Information to help ensure the security of the transaction, like information about your device or connection
*   Any information required by applicable regulation
*   Other information you choose to share with them

For example, if you donate to a charity that receives funds through PayPal Giving Fund, your donation will be made to PayPal Giving Fund. The PayPal Giving Fund will receive information such as the transaction amount and name of the charity. Their payment service provider will also receive information needed to facilitate the payment, including your payment card credential information.

Integrated partners
-------------------

When you choose to use integrated partners’ products or services, they may receive information about you and your activity. [Read the Policy](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.8-IntegratedPartnersWhenYou#3.subpage.4-WhenYouUseAn).

Measurement vendors
-------------------

We don’t create every measurement and analytics report ourselves.

We share information (like whether people saw an ad or engaged with it) with our [measurement vendors\[56\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.10-MeasurementVendors#annotation-56), who aggregate or compile it to provide their reports.

For example, an advertiser might ask a measurement vendor to help figure out the impact its ads on Facebook have had on sales. The measurement vendor compares information from us about clicks on the advertiser’s Facebook ads with information from the advertiser about product purchases. Then the measurement vendor creates and provides aggregated reports that show the advertiser how its ads are performing.

Marketing vendors
-----------------

We share information about you with [marketing vendors\[57\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.11-MarketingVendors#annotation-57). For example, we share your device identifier or other identifiers with marketing vendors to help us serve you ads most relevant to your interests.

Marketing vendors support our marketing and advertising efforts by:

*   Serving our advertisements across the internet, including on mobile, desktop and connected television devices
*   Tracking and categorizing your online and mobile app activity
*   Providing us information about your interests and community and advertising interactions

These marketing vendors help us understand who might find our advertising most relevant to their interests, and which of our Products might interest you. This information can be used to personalize which of our ads are shown to you. Marketing vendors also use this information to measure response to our marketing efforts and the effectiveness of our advertising.

Service providers
-----------------

Service providers provide services to us that help us provide our Products to you. We share the information we have about you to receive these services, which include:

*   Investigating suspicious activity
*   Detecting and stopping threats to our personnel and property
*   Facilitating payments
*   Providing customer support
*   Improving the functionality of our Products
*   Providing technical infrastructure services
*   Analyzing how our Products are used
*   Conducting research and surveys
*   Marketing and promoting our Products

External researchers
--------------------

We provide information to external researchers. They use it to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation, and to promote safety, security and integrity.

Research goals include supporting:

*   Our business or mission
*   Social good. [Learn more](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.14-ExternalResearchersWeProvide).
*   Technological advancement
*   Safety and security on our Products
*   Public interest
*   Health and well-being

When sharing information with external researchers, we ensure the privacy of our users is protected. [Learn more](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Flm.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.fb.com%2Fen-gb%2Fresearchtools%2F%3Fentry_point%3DPOLICY_SUBPAGE%253A4.subpage.14-ExternalResearchersWeProvide) about the privacy-safe research we support.

AI integrations
---------------

Generative AI models that make our features work may not have the most complete or recent information. For example, that means if you ask Meta AI about the score to yesterday's football game, it might not know the right answer. That's why we work with other selected partners, like search engine providers. We sometimes share certain information with these partners so we can bring you the most relevant information.

[Learn more about how we share your information with these selected partners](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/dialog/ai-partners?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.15-AiIntegrations)

You can [object](https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/367438723733209?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A7.subpage.11-ObjectYouHaveThe) to our processing your information when we rely on legitimate interests or perform a task in the public interest.

How long do we keep your information?
=====================================

Highlights
----------

*   We keep information for as long as we need it to provide a feature or service
*   But you can request that we delete your information
*   We’ll delete that information unless we have to keep it for something else, like for legal reasons

We keep information as long as we need it to provide our Products, comply with legal obligations or protect our or other’s interests. We decide how long we need information on a case-by-case basis. Here’s what we consider when we decide:

*   If we need it to operate or provide our Products. For example, we need to keep some of your information to maintain your account. [Learn more\[63\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A8-HowLongDoWe#annotation-63).
*   The feature we use it for, and how that feature works. For example, messages sent using Messenger’s vanish mode are retained for less time than regular messages. [Learn more\[64\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A8-HowLongDoWe#annotation-64).
*   How long we need to retain the information to comply with certain legal obligations. [See some examples\[65\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A8-HowLongDoWe#annotation-65).
*   If we need it for other legitimate purposes, such as to prevent harm; investigate possible violations of our terms or policies; promote safety, security and integrity; or protect ourselves, including our rights, property or products

In some instances and for specific reasons, we’ll keep information for an extended period of time. [Read our Policy\[66\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A8-HowLongDoWe#annotation-66) about when we may preserve your information.

How do we transfer information?
===============================

Highlights
----------

*   Because we connect people all around the world, we need to transfer information all around the world, too
*   When we do this, we follow international regulations to keep your information safe

Why is information transferred to other countries?
--------------------------------------------------

We share the [information we collect](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A9.subpage.1-WhyIsInformationTransferred#1-WhatInformationDoWe) globally, both internally across our offices and data centers, and externally with our [partners\[69\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A9.subpage.1-WhyIsInformationTransferred#annotation-69), [measurement vendors\[70\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A9.subpage.1-WhyIsInformationTransferred#annotation-70), [service providers\[71\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A9.subpage.1-WhyIsInformationTransferred#annotation-71) and other [third parties\[72\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A9.subpage.1-WhyIsInformationTransferred#annotation-72). Because Meta is global, with users, partners and employees around the world, transfers are necessary for a variety of reasons, including:

*   So we can operate and provide the services stated in the terms of the [Meta Product\[73\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A9.subpage.1-WhyIsInformationTransferred#annotation-73) you’re using and this Policy. This includes allowing you to share information and connect with your family and friends around the globe.

Where is information transferred?
---------------------------------

Information controlled by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited will be transferred or transmitted to, or stored and processed in:

*   Places we have infrastructure or data centers, including the United States, Ireland, Denmark and Sweden, among others
*   Countries where Meta Company Products are available
*   Other countries where our partners, vendors, service providers and other third parties are located outside of the country where you live, for purposes as described in this Policy

How do we safeguard your information?
-------------------------------------

We rely on [appropriate mechanisms\[74\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A9.subpage.3-HowDoWeSafeguard#annotation-74) for international data transfers.

We also make sure that appropriate safeguards are in place whenever we transfer your information. For example, we encrypt your information when it’s in transit over public networks to protect it from unauthorized access.

[How information is safeguarded as it’s transferred to the United States](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Flm.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.fb.com%2Fnews%2F2021%2F03%2Fsteps-we-take-to-transfer-data-securely%2F%3Fentry_point%3DPOLICY_SUBPAGE%253A9.subpage.3-HowDoWeSafeguard)

How do we respond to legal requests, comply with applicable law and prevent harm?
=================================================================================

Highlights
----------

*   Sometimes we have to provide information to respond to legal requests when necessary
*   If there’s a law that says we need to keep your information for some reason, we need to comply with it. So we’ll keep information to obey that law.
*   We also sometimes keep information that we think will help prevent or stop bad activity, either on our Products or in the world

We access, preserve, use and share your information:

*   In response to legal requests, like search warrants, court orders, production orders or subpoenas. These requests come from [third parties\[76\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A10-HowDoWeRespond#annotation-76) such as civil litigants, law enforcement and other government authorities. [Learn more\[77\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A10-HowDoWeRespond#annotation-77) about when we respond to legal requests.
*   In accordance with applicable law

When we process information that you provide to us as necessary for concluding or performing our contracts with you, you have the right to port it under the GDPR. To exercise your rights, visit the Facebook settings and Instagram settings, or learn more in our Help Centers.

The categories of information we use, why we process your information based on compliance with a legal obligation and how it’s processed are set out below:

Processing information when required by law

**Why and how we process your information:**

For processing information when the law requires it: Where we are under an obligation to disclose information such as, for example, if we receive a valid legal request for certain information (such as an Irish search warrant), we will access, preserve and / or share your information with regulators, law enforcement or others.

The way in which the information will be processed depends on the specific circumstances, see [How do we respond to legal requests, prevent harm and promote safety and integrity?](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBSECTION%3A18.3-ComplianceWithALegal#10-HowDoWeRespond) for more. [Information for Law Enforcement Authorities](https://www.facebook.com/safety/groups/law/guidelines?entry_point=POLICY_SUBSECTION%3A18.3-ComplianceWithALegal) provides information on the operational guidelines law enforcement needs to follow.

Examples of Irish and EU laws enforceable in Ireland that could give rise to an obligation requiring us to process the information we hold about you are:

*   Civil and commercial matters: where we are in receipt of a court order or otherwise required to disclose information for the purposes of court proceedings, such as under Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters.
*   Criminal matters: to comply with requests from Irish law enforcement to provide information in relation to an investigation, such as under Section 10 of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997 as amended by 6(1)(a) of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, or to take steps to report information to law enforcement where required.
*   Consumer matters: to comply with our obligations under consumer law such as the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014.
