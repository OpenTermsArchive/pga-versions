The information we collect and process about you depends on how you use our [Products\[3\]](#annotation-3).

Here's the information we collect:

Friends, followers and other connections
----------------------------------------

We collect information about friends, followers, groups, accounts, Facebook Pages and other users and communities you’re connected to and interact with. This includes how you interact with them across our Products and which ones you interact with the most.

We also collect your contacts’ information, such as their name and email address or phone number, if you choose to upload or import it from a [device\[10\]](#annotation-10), like by syncing an address book.

If you don’t use Meta Products, or use them without an account, your information might still be collected. [Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/637205020878504) about how Meta uses contact information uploaded by account holders.

We collect information about you based on others' activity. [See some examples\[11\]](#annotation-11).

* We take into account whether your friends belong to a group when we suggest you join it.

App, browser and device information

These partners collect your information when you visit their site or app or use their services, or through other businesses or organizations they work with. We require partners to have the right to collect, use and share your information before giving it to us.

We process certain information we receive from partners as a joint controller with them. [Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/legal/controller_addendum) about our arrangements with these partners.

This Policy describes the information we, Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, process to provide [Meta Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/1561485474074139/), which we also call "Products."

4

Even if you don't have an account, you may interact with or use [Meta Products\[3\]](#annotation-3). Then we collect things like:

* Browser and app logs of your visits to public content, like Facebook Pages, videos and [rooms](https://www.facebook.com/help/211931886925431/)
* Basic information about [devices\[10\]](#annotation-10) that downloaded our apps, like device model and OS

We also receive information using cookies and similar technologies, like the Meta Pixel or Social Plugins, when you visit other websites and apps that use our [Business Tools](https://www.facebook.com/help/331509497253087/?helpref=uf_share) or other Meta Products. Read more about information we receive from partners, vendors and other third parties in [this policy](#4-HowDoWeShare) and in our [Cookies Policy](https://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies).

Examples of why we collect and receive information
--------------------------------------------------

### Security of our Products

For example, we collect information to monitor attempted attacks on our systems, such as overloading our servers with traffic. Also, if we see someone without an account trying to load too many pages, they could be trying to [scrape](https://www.facebook.com/help/463983701520800/?helpref=search) our site in violation of our terms. Then we can take action to prevent it.

### Safety and integrity

For example, if someone without an account joins a room and shares a harmful video, we can take action according to our Community Standards. We can remove content that violates our terms and policies, or share information with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of death or imminent bodily harm.

### Performance

For example, we collect information when people use our Products, even if they don’t have an account, to measure how fast our pages load in different countries and whether they're working properly. This helps us identify and fix issues with local networks.

Learn more about the [information we collect and use if you don't have an account](https://www.facebook.com/help/637205020878504) and [our legal basis](#18.4-LegitimateInterestsWeRely) for doing so.

5

For example, when you create a Facebook account, you must provide some information, like a password and your email address or phone number, age and gender. You might choose to add other details to your account, like a profile photo or payment information.

We also collect information you provide when you:

* Create your avatar
* Fill out a form
* Contact us

6

What we collect from our camera feature
---------------------------------------

José likes using Instagram’s Camera feature to take pictures of his flower garden. We collect information about how José uses the Camera feature. For example, if he chooses a background effect for the photo he’s about to take, we collect information from the camera so we can apply the effect to his photo.

How filters, effects, masks and avatars work
--------------------------------------------

If you use our camera or allow access to photos and videos, on certain Meta Products you can add filters, effects, masks or avatars. Some of these features process parts of faces or bodies within the camera frame, photo or video. Then they can do things like fit a mask correctly over the eyes, nose and mouth. The information we use for this process is used to create the feature. It’s not used to identify you.

What we collect from voice-enabled features
-------------------------------------------

Ren tells Meta’s voice-enabled Assistant to take a photo on smart glasses. A visual indicator shows that Assistant is activated and listening for Ren’s command. We collect this voice interaction, which includes any background sound that occurs when Ren says the command. Collecting Ren’s voice interactions lets us provide and, depending on Ren’s settings, improve the Assistant feature.

7

* Information about the content itself, like the location where a photo was taken or the date a file was created
* Information about the message itself, like the type of message or the date and time it was sent

8

For example, we log:

* What apps, posts, videos, ads, games, Shops and other content you view or interact with on our Products
* What features you access from our messaging products
* When you use [Social Plugins](https://developers.facebook.com/products/social-plugins/), [Facebook Login](https://developers.facebook.com/products/facebook-login/), in-app browser link history or autofill
* Information about websites that you visit or interact with when you use our in-app browser. [Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/206578174518231).

9

We collect information when you use our Products to buy or sell things or make or receive financial transactions.

Some examples are:

* Purchases within an online game
* Donations to a friend’s fundraiser
* Purchases of subscriptions on Meta Products
* Payments received for providing products or services on Meta Products
* Payments or purchases made using Meta Pay or other Meta checkout experiences

### What we collect from transactions

When you use our Products to buy or sell things or make or receive financial transactions, including payments made using Meta Pay or other Meta checkout experiences, we collect information about your purchase or other financial transactions, like:

* Credit or debit card number and other financial account information
* Billing, shipping and contact details
* Items you bought and how many
* Other account and authentication information

### Why we collect this information

We collect and store this information to facilitate your purchase, receipt of payments and other financial transactions, to personalize your experience on our Products, for advertising and to allow you to access and view your payment and transaction history, where available. And, depending on your choices, we store this information to provide you faster and easier payment and financial transactions experiences.

[How do we use your information?](#2-HowDoWeUse)[How do we respond to legal requests, comply with applicable law and prevent harm?](#10-HowDoWeRespond)

10

Devices include computers, phones, hardware, connected TVs, Meta Quest and other web-connected devices.

11

13

Identifiers we collect include device IDs, mobile advertiser ID or IDs from games, apps or accounts you use. We also collect Family Device IDs or other identifiers unique to [Meta Company Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/195227921252400?ref=dp) associated with the same device or account.

14

Device signals include GPS, Bluetooth signals, nearby Wi-Fi access points, beacons and cell towers.

15

For example, if you give us permission to access your device’s camera roll, we collect metadata. This metadata is from and about your photos and videos and includes the date and time they were made. We use this to do things like remind you when you have new photos to upload.

16

Stands for "internet protocol address." It’s a unique number assigned to a device, like a phone or computer, that allows it to communicate over the internet. Numbers are assigned according to standard guidelines, or protocols.

Just like you need a mailing address to receive a letter from a friend, your device needs an IP address to receive information on the internet.

17

Information about your network and connection includes:

* The name of your mobile operator or internet service provider (ISP)
* Language
* Time zone
* Mobile phone number
* IP address
* Connection and download speed
* Network capability
* Information about other devices that are nearby or on your network
* Wi-Fi hotspots you connect to using our Products

One reason we collect this information is to make your experience better. For example, if we know that your phone and TV are connected to the same network, we can help you use your phone to control a video stream on your TV.

[How do we use your information?](#2-HowDoWeUse)

18

We collect device information to prevent, diagnose, troubleshoot and fix errors and bugs. This includes how long the app was running, what model of device you were using and other performance and diagnostic information.

19

Cookies are small pieces of text used to store information on web browsers. We use cookies and similar technologies, including data that we store on your web browser or device, identifiers associated with your device and other software, Social Plugins and the Meta Pixel. They help us provide, protect and improve our Products, such as by personalizing content, tailoring and measuring ads and providing a safer experience.

We collect information from cookies stored on your device, including cookie IDs and settings.

Read our [Meta Cookies Policy](https://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies/).

Or they might use Meta Audience Network tools to monetize their apps by showing ads from businesses that advertise on Facebook.

We use [information we collect](#1-WhatInformationDoWe) to provide a personalized experience to you, including ads (if we show you ads on Meta Products), along with the other purposes we explain in detail below.

For some of these purposes, we use information [across our Products\[25\]](#annotation-25) from the accounts you choose to add to your Accounts Center, and [across your devices\[26\]](#annotation-26). The information we use for these purposes is automatically processed by our systems. But in some cases, we also use [manual review\[27\]](#annotation-27) to access and review your information.

To use less information that’s connected to individual users, in some cases we de-identify or aggregate information or anonymize it so that it no longer identifies you. We use this information in the same ways we use your information as described in this section.

Here are the ways we use your information:

We use information we have to provide and improve our [Products\[28\]](#annotation-28). This includes personalizing features, content and [recommendations](https://www.facebook.com/help/1257205004624246), such as your [Facebook Feed\[29\]](#annotation-29), [Instagram Feed](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Flm.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F1986234648360433%2F), Stories and ads (if we show you ads on Meta Products).

How we show ads (if we show you ads on Meta Products)

To provide our Products for free, we use your information to show you ads, which advertisers, businesses, organizations and others pay us to show you. We want everything you see to be interesting and useful to you, so we personalize ads for you and measure how they perform. We use information from your account or across accounts in your Accounts Center and cookies on our Products for this. You can control whether we show you ads and which information we use to show you ads in [Ad Preferences](https://accountscenter.facebook.com/ad_preferences).

[See some examples.\[30\]](#annotation-30)

How we use information to improve our Products
----------------------------------------------

We’re always trying to make our Products better and create new ones with the features you want. Information we collect from you helps us learn how.

We use information we collect to:

* See if a product is working correctly
* Troubleshoot and fix it when it’s not
* Test out new products and features to see if they work
* Get feedback on our ideas for products or features
* Conduct surveys and other research about what you like about our Products and brands and what we can do better

How we use location-related information
---------------------------------------

We use location-related information that you allow us to receive if you turn on the Location Services device setting. This includes things like your GPS location and, depending on the operating system you're using, other [device signals\[31\]](#annotation-31).

We also receive and use some location-related information even if Location Services is turned off. This includes:

* [IP addresses\[32\]](#annotation-32), which we use to estimate your general location. We can use IP addresses to estimate your specific location if it’s necessary to protect the safety and security of you or others.
* Your and others' activity on our Products, like check-ins and events
* Information you give us directly, like if you enter your current city on your profile, or provide your address in Marketplace

We use location-related information, such as your current location, where you live, the places you like to go and the businesses and people you're near, to do the things described in the [“How do we use your information?” section of the Policy](#2-HowDoWeUse), like:

* Provide, personalize and improve our Products, including ads (if we show you ads on Meta Products), for you and others. [See an example\[33\]](#annotation-33).
* Detect suspicious activity and help keep your account secure. [Learn how.\[34\]](#annotation-34)

Providing measurement, analytics and business services
------------------------------------------------------

To provide measurement and analytics services, we use the [information we collect about you](#1-WhatInformationDoWe) across your accounts on our Products.

Our measurement and analytics services help our [partners\[35\]](#annotation-35) and users understand things like:

* How many people see and interact with their products, services or content, including posts, videos, Facebook Pages, listings, Shops and ads (if we show you ads on Meta Products, including ads shown through apps using [Meta Audience Network](https://www.facebook.com/audiencenetwork/))
* How people interact with their content, websites, apps and services
* What [types of people\[36\]](#annotation-36) interact with their content or use their services
* How people use our partners' products and services to connect to Meta Products, the performance of their connection and networks and users' experience with them

We also use the information we collect to provide business services.

[How do we share information with partners, vendors, service providers and other third parties?](#4-HowDoWeShare)

Communicating with you
----------------------

We communicate with you in a few different ways. For example:

* We send messages about the Products we know you use, using the email you register to your account
* Depending on your settings, we send marketing communications about Products you might like
* We ask you to participate in research based on things like how you use our Products
* We let you know about our policies and terms of service
* When you contact us with questions, we reply to your email
* We facilitate customer support communications with you when you've told us, either directly or through a [third party\[37\]](#annotation-37), that you have questions or concerns about our Products

Researching and innovating for social good
------------------------------------------

We research and innovate to help people around the world. Our goals include:

* Contributing to social good and areas of public interest
* Advancing technology
* Improving safety, health and well-being

Here are some examples of our research:

* [We analyze information](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/dfg/tools/displacement-maps) about where groups of people go during crises. This helps relief organizations get aid to the right places.
* We work with independent researchers to better understand the impact social media might have on elections and democratic processes

If you choose to add your accounts to the same Accounts Center, we'll combine your [information across your accounts](https://www.meta.com/help/accounts-center/Information-used-across-accounts/). Here's what we'll use it for, we'll:

* Provide you with controls over [connected experiences](https://www.meta.com/help/accounts-center/enable-connected-experiences-accounts-center/)
* If we show you ads on Meta Products, [personalize ads for you](#2.subpage.2-HowWeShowAds) and others and [measure how they perform](#2.subpage.10-ProvidingMeasurementAnalyticsAnd)
* Personalize content and suggestions for you and others. [See an example\[38\]](#annotation-38)
* Adjust some of your accounts information and settings to match across your accounts, [which you can manage anytime](https://www.meta.com/help/accounts-center/manage-settings-across-accounts/)
* Suggest friends and accounts to follow
* Improve our Products and provide optional activities that span across them

Even if you don't add your accounts to the same Accounts Center, we use information across your accounts to:

* Keep you and others safe
* More accurately count people and measure how they use our Products
* Make sure our Products are working correctly so we can fix them if they’re not

[How to add or delete accounts in your Accounts Center Facebook Help Center](https://www.facebook.com/help/213446087365127/)

[Manage accounts](https://accountscenter.facebook.com/accounts/)

26

One reason we use your information across [devices\[39\]](#annotation-39) is to help us give you a more personalized experience. For example, we might show you an ad on your phone, and later you might use your laptop to click on the ad and buy the product. By combining that information across your devices, we can understand what ads are relevant to you and help businesses measure how well their ad performed.

27

### Examples of when we use manual review

* Our reviewers help us promote safety, security and integrity across our Products. For example, reviewers can look for and remove content that violates our terms and policies and keep content that doesn’t break our terms and policies available. Their work supplements our [technology that detects violations](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Flm.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.fb.com%2Fen-gb%2Fenforcement%2Fdetecting-violations%2Ftechnology-detects-violations%2F).
* When our algorithms detect that [someone might need help](https://www.facebook.com/safety/wellbeing/suicideprevention), a reviewer can review their post and offer support if needed.
* We also use manual review to analyze content to train our algorithms to review content the same way a person would. This improves our automatic processing, which in turn helps us improve our products.

### Who reviews this information

Our reviewers work at Meta, for [Meta Companies](https://www.facebook.com/help/111814505650678?ref=tos) or for a trusted [service provider\[40\]](#annotation-40). We require every reviewer who's allowed access to your information to meet privacy and security standards.

[Learn more](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Flm.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.fb.com%2Fpolicies%2Fimproving%2Fprioritizing-content-review%2F) about how Meta prioritizes content for manual review.

28

This Policy describes the information we, Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, process to provide [Meta Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/1561485474074139/), which we also call "Products."

29

Your Facebook Feed is unique to you. We order (or “rank”) the content you can see in your Feed, and you can [learn more](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Flm.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.fb.com%2Fen-gb%2Ffeatures%2Franking-and-content%2F) about the different types of signals we use to rank it. We also suggest content that’s relevant to you.

Many things influence the content you see in your Feed.

For example:

* If your friends, connections or people you may know interact with a Facebook Page, post or certain topic, we can suggest similar content to you. So if your friend Ahmad comments on a post about national parks, we can suggest the national parks post to you.
* If you and others interact with the same group, Facebook Page or post, we can suggest another group, Page or post that they interact with for you. So if you and Sharmila are in the same cat lovers group and Sharmila likes a Page that sells scarves, we might suggest the scarves Page to you.
* If you’ve recently engaged with a certain topic on Facebook, we might then suggest other posts that are related to that topic. So if you recently liked or commented on a post from a basketball Page, we could suggest other posts about basketball.
* You might see posts based on where you are and what people near you are interacting with on Facebook. So if you’re near a sports stadium, we can suggest games or events occurring at the stadium. [Learn more](#2.subpage.6-HowWeUseLocation) about how we use location-related information.

Your activity on our Products
-----------------------------

For example, William checks into a local bakery on Facebook, so later we might show him ads on Instagram for other local bakeries.

Your activity on third-party websites and apps, depending on your settings
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

For example, Jane buys a pair of shoes from an online shoe store or in an online chat with a shoe seller. The seller shares Jane’s activity with us using our Business Tools, subject to our Business Tools Terms.

Later, Jane sees an ad on Instagram for a discount on her next shoe purchase from the online store.

If she doesn't want to see ads from this shoe store again, she can hide them in her [Advertisers setting](https://www.facebook.com/adpreferences/advertisers). Or if she doesn’t want us to show her any ads based on her activity on other websites and apps, she can make sure that this setting is turned off in her [Ad preferences](https://www.facebook.com/adpreferences/ad_settings).

Topics we think you might be interested in
------------------------------------------

For example, Jon likes several Facebook Pages about famous musicians, so we think he has an interest in "music."

Based on this interest, we might show him an ad for a local record shop or an online music publication.

Jon can manage his interests in his [ad topics](https://www.facebook.com/adpreferences/ad_topics).

Your connections
----------------

For example, Fiona’s friend likes an Instagram account for a local art fair. Based on her friend’s activity, we might show Fiona an ad for the art fair.

31

We receive different types of device signals from different operating systems. They include things like nearby Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections.

32

Stands for "internet protocol address." It’s a unique number assigned to a device, like a phone or computer, that allows it to communicate over the internet. Numbers are assigned according to standard guidelines, or protocols.

Just like you need a mailing address to receive a letter from a friend, your device needs an IP address to receive information on the internet.

33

Personalizing ads for you and others
------------------------------------

For example, Marcus is going on a trip and wants to use Find Wi-Fi to find free, public Wi-Fi at the airport. He has turned on Location Services on his device and allowed location access on the Facebook app, so we can use his GPS information to help him find the most relevant public Wi-Fi networks. We’ll also use this information to show him ads for local businesses near the airport.

Later, Marcus turns off Location Services before he lands, so we don’t collect his GPS information anymore. Later on his trip, he opens the Facebook app, and we can use the IP address we receive to estimate Marcus’ general location and show him ads for businesses nearby.

34

For example, we use information about the locations you normally log in from, combined with other information, to detect suspicious activity. So if we detect an attempt to log into your account from a new location, we can check that it’s really you.

35

A person, business, organization or body using or integrating our Products to advertise, market or support their products and services

36

For example, we might tell an advertiser that their ad was seen by women aged 25–34 who live in Madrid and like software engineering.

37

A person, business, organization or body that is not part of the Meta Companies

38

For example we can:

* Automatically fill in registration information, like your phone number, from one Meta Product when you sign up for an account on a different Product
* Let others see and search your name and profile photo across our Products and communicate with you
* Show all interactions in one place for content you’ve cross-posted to different Products

39

Devices include computers, phones, hardware, connected TVs, Meta Quest and other web-connected devices.

40

A person, business, organization or body that provides services to Meta or to our users on behalf of Meta. For example, our service providers do things like investigate suspicious activity and provide customer support.

Learn more about the different cases when your information can be shared on our [Products\[41\]](#annotation-41):

People and accounts you share and communicate with
--------------------------------------------------

When you share and communicate using our Products, you can sometimes [choose the audience\[42\]](#annotation-42) for what you share.

When you interact with people or businesses, they can see:

For example, the audience you choose can see when you:

* Share a post you’ve written
* Share a photo or video
* Create a story
* Share a news article
* Add information to your profile

People you interact with can see what you send to them. So if you send a person or a business a message on Messenger or Instagram, that person or business can read your message.

Learn how to update your Active Status on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/help/215888465102253?helpref=faq_content) and [Messenger](https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/278118979024443), or how to update your Activity Status on [Instagram](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Flm.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F1164377657035425).

Some accounts are [supervised\[43\]](#annotation-43). When you interact with a supervised user, their parent or guardian can see some of your activity and information. This can include information like your username, profile picture and if the supervised user blocked you. On some Products, the supervised user can let their parent or guardian know if they reported you.

Content others share or reshare about you
-----------------------------------------

People in your audience can view your content and can choose to share it with others outside your audience, on and off our Products. For example, when you share a post or send a message to specific friends, they can download, screenshot or reshare it with anyone, on, across or off our Products.

When you comment on a post or react to a photo, your comment or reaction can be seen by anyone who can see the post or photo. This can include people you aren’t connected to. The person who shared the post can also change their audience at any time after you’ve interacted with it.

People who use our Products can share information about you with the audience they choose. For example, they can:

* Share a photo or video of you in a post, comment, story, reel or message
* Mention you in a post or story
* Tag you in a post, comment, story or location
* Share details about you in a post, story or message

Public content
--------------

Some of your information and activity are always public. This includes your:

* Name
* Facebook and Instagram username
* Profile picture
* Activity on public groups, Facebook Pages and channels
* Activity on content that is public. For example, your comment, rating or review on Marketplace, or on a public Instagram account.
* Avatars

Other content you can choose to set to Public, like posts, photos and videos you post to your profile, Stories or Reels.

When content is public, it can be seen by anyone on or across our Products, and in some cases off our Products, even if they don’t have an account.

For example, if you comment on Marketplace, a Facebook Page or a public Instagram account, or if you leave a rating or review, your comment, rating or review will be visible to anyone. It could appear in any of our Products or be seen by anyone, including off our Products.

We, you and people using our Products can send public content (like your profile photo, or information you share on a Facebook Page or public Instagram account) to anyone on, across or off our Products. For example, users can share it in a public forum, or it can appear in search results on the internet.

Public content can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through third-party services, like:

* Search engines. [Learn more\[44\]](#annotation-44).

You can choose to connect with [integrated partners\[45\]](#annotation-45) who use our Products. If you do, these integrated partners receive information about you and your activity.

These integrated partners can always access information that’s public on our Products. Learn more about other information they receive and how they handle your information:

When you use an integrated partner’s product or service
-------------------------------------------------------

When you use an integrated partner’s products or services, they can access:

* What you post or share from these products or services
* What you use their services to do
* Information from and about the device you’re using
* The language setting you’ve chosen on our Products

[See examples\[46\]](#annotation-46) of when an integrated partner might receive your information.

Sometimes these integrated partners ask you for permission to access certain additional information from your Facebook, Instagram or Messenger account. In their request, they’ll explain what information they’d like to access and let you choose whether to share it.

On Facebook, this includes things like your email address, hometown or birthday. On Instagram, this includes content, like photos and videos, that you’ve shared from your account when the account was set to private.

[Learn what happens if you choose to share your friends list, or if your friends choose to share their friends list.\[47\]](#annotation-47)

We automatically log when you receive a request from an integrated partner to access your information. These requests to access information are separate from the Apps and Websites access that you manage in your Facebook or Instagram Ad settings or in your mobile device settings.

Apps or websites you’ve logged into using Facebook Login or connected to your Instagram account can access your nonpublic information on Meta Products unless it appears to us that you haven’t used the app or website in 90 days. Note that even if an app’s access to your information has expired, it can still retain information you shared with it previously.

We encourage you to visit your Apps and Websites settings from time to time to review which apps and websites continue to have access to your information through Facebook Login or Instagram.

When you interact with someone else’s content on an integrated partner’s product or service
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Integrated partners receive information about your activity when you interact with other Facebook, Instagram or Messenger users while they’re using the integrated partner’s product or service.

For example, a gamer livestreams to Facebook using a partner app. Then you comment on that livestream. The app developer will receive information about your comment.

How integrated partners handle your information
-----------------------------------------------

Integrated partners handle the information you share with them according to their own terms and policies, not Meta’s. You can review their privacy policy on their website or app to learn how they receive and process your information. In some cases, they use a separate service provider to receive and process your information.

On Instagram, you can set the audience for what you share by choosing between a private or public account. With a [private account](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Flm.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F448523408565555), only followers you approve can see what you share. With a public account, your posts and other content on Instagram can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if they don’t have an account. You can restrict the audience for your content by blocking individual accounts from viewing them. You can also create a close friends list for certain types of content that only the people on that list can see.

[Audience settings Manage your audience settings on Facebook or Instagram.](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/logging/?target=POLICY_PLATFORM_LINK_COLLECTION%3AAUDIENCE_SETTINGS&element=privacy_policy_list_cell&containing_element_id=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A3.ex.2-ChoosingAnAudienceOn&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmbasic.facebook.com%2Fprivacy%2Fpolicy%2Fprintable%2F%3Flink_dialog%3DAUDIENCE_SETTINGS%26entry%3D0)

### Audience settings are different from app permissions

Your audience settings are different from the permissions you give to individual apps and websites to access your information. [Read our policy](#3.subpage.4-WhenYouUseAn) about how you may share information with integrated partners.

Supervision provides supervisors chosen by a teen, like parents and guardians, with tools and insights to help support a teen account.

44

You can visit your [privacy settings](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=privacy) to control whether search engines outside Facebook can link to your profile. But other public content–like if you post with your audience set to Public, or post on public Pages or accounts–might still be accessible through search engines, depending on the settings of that account.

45

A partner who uses technologies that help you make a connection to them through our Products, including plugins, login, checkout experiences, instant games, and other such integrations

When an integrated partner might receive your information
---------------------------------------------------------

For example, you might use your Facebook login to play an online game with your Facebook friends. The game developer automatically receives information about your activities in the game.

When an integrated partner might receive your information
---------------------------------------------------------

Or you might use the Facebook Like button on an article posted on a news website. The website developer automatically receives information about your Like on their article.

47

### When you share your friends list

If you use Facebook Login to log into an app, the app developer might request access to your list of Facebook friends. Here's what happens if you give the app developer permission to view these lists:

* They can view and access a list of your Facebook friends who use the same app and have given the app permission to access their list of friends. They can’t access nonpublic information about your friends or followers through this process. Note that the app developer will receive more information about your friends if your friends choose to share it themselves. They can share it by providing the information directly or giving the developer permission to access information from their account.
* You’ll appear on friends lists that your Facebook friends can choose to share with the same app. You can remove this permission, or the app entirely, if you later decide that you don’t want to share your friends list with an app, or don’t want to appear on other friends lists shared with that app.

### When your friends share their friends list

Your friends might choose to share their friends lists with app developers through Facebook Login. But your friends can’t use Facebook Login to share nonpublic information about you.

How do we share information with third parties?
===============================================

Highlights
----------

We share certain information with:

* Advertisers who show ads on our Products
* Businesses we hire to market our Products for us
* Businesses we hire to do things like offer customer service or conduct surveys
* Researchers who use it to do things like innovate, advance technology, or improve people’s safety

We don’t sell your information, and we never will.

We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and we never will. We also require [partners\[48\]](#annotation-48) and other [third parties\[49\]](#annotation-49) to follow rules about how they can and cannot use and disclose the information we provide.

Here’s more detail about who we share information with:

Advertisers and Audience Network publishers (if we show you ads on Meta Products)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Advertisers

We provide advertisers with reports about the number and kinds of people who see and engage with their ads. These reports include information about the general demographics and interests of people who engaged with an advertiser’s ad. Then advertisers can better understand their audience. [See an example\[50\]](#annotation-50).

Meta also provides advertisers and their vendors with information about:

* Ads people engaged with, if any
* When people engaged with ads
* Where that ad was shown (for example, on Instagram, or on Facebook)

We also confirm which ads you viewed that led you to take an action with an advertiser, such as downloading an advertiser's app. But we don't share information with these advertisers and their vendors that by itself can be used to contact or identify you, such as your name or email address, unless you [give us permission.\[51\]](#annotation-51)

### Audience Network publishers and their vendors

Meta Audience Network lets advertisers place ads with us that will be published on other apps and websites outside of Meta.

To help show you ads on their apps and websites, we share information with publishers who use Audience Network, as well as vendors who facilitate that use. For example, we share:

* How many people see and engage with ads on publisher apps
* Information related to or in response to a [publisher’s request](https://www.facebook.com/help/119468292028768?ref=shareable) to serve an ad on its app.

But we don't share information with these publishers and their vendors that by itself can be used to contact or identify you, such as your name or email address, unless you [give us permission\[51\]](#annotation-51).

Partners who use our analytics services
---------------------------------------

People rely on our [Products\[52\]](#annotation-52), like business accounts, professional tools and Facebook Pages, to run and promote their businesses. Businesses use our analytics services to understand more about how people are using their content, features, products and services.

To provide these services, we use the [information we collect](#1-WhatInformationDoWe) about you. We put this information into aggregate reports so that partners can see how well their content, features, products and services are performing and are able to understand things like users’ experience with such content, products and services.

These reports aggregate information like:

* How many people interacted with our partners' content, products or services
* The [general demographics and interests\[50\]](#annotation-50) of the people who interacted with it
* How people use our partners’ products and services to connect to Meta Products and the performance of their connection and networks

Advertisers also receive other information. [Read our Policy](#4.subpage.2-AdvertisersAndAudienceNetwork) about how we share information with advertisers.

Partners who offer goods or services on our Products and commerce services platforms
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you choose to [make a transaction\[53\]](#annotation-53), or otherwise choose to share information with a seller, creator, fundraiser, charity, payment services provider or [commerce services platform\[54\]](#annotation-54), we share information with them and with any providers acting on their behalf.

Depending on how you interact with them, they receive:

* Information to complete your transaction, like order, payment, contact and shipping information
* Information to help ensure the security of the transaction, like information about your device or connection
* Any information required by applicable regulation
* Other information you choose to share with them

For example, if you donate to a charity that receives funds through PayPal Giving Fund, your donation will be made to PayPal Giving Fund. The PayPal Giving Fund will receive information such as the transaction amount and name of the charity. Their payment service provider will also receive information needed to facilitate the payment, including your payment card credential information.

Integrated partners
-------------------

When you choose to use integrated partners’ products or services, they may receive information about you and your activity. [Read the Policy](#3.subpage.4-WhenYouUseAn).

Measurement vendors
-------------------

We don’t create every measurement and analytics report ourselves.

We share information (like whether people saw an ad or engaged with it) with our [measurement vendors\[55\]](#annotation-55), who aggregate it to provide their reports.

For example, an advertiser might ask a measurement vendor to help figure out the impact its ads on Facebook have had on sales. The measurement vendor compares information from us about clicks on the advertiser’s Facebook ads with information from the advertiser about product purchases. Then the measurement vendor creates and provides aggregated reports that show the advertiser how its ads are performing.

Marketing vendors
-----------------

We share information about you with [marketing vendors\[56\]](#annotation-56). For example, we share your device identifier or other identifiers with marketing vendors to help us serve you ads most relevant to your interests.

Marketing vendors support our marketing and advertising efforts by:

* Serving our advertisements across the internet, including on mobile, desktop and connected television devices
* Tracking and categorizing your online and mobile app activity
* Providing us information about your interests and community and advertising interactions

These marketing vendors help us understand who might find our advertising most relevant to their interests, and which of our Products might interest you. This information can be used to personalize which of our ads are shown to you. Marketing vendors also use this information to measure response to our marketing efforts and the effectiveness of our advertising.

Service providers
-----------------

Service providers provide services to us that help us provide our Products to you. We share the information we have about you to receive these services, which include:

* Investigating suspicious activity
* Detecting and stopping threats to our personnel and property
* Facilitating payments
* Providing customer support
* Improving the functionality of our Products
* Providing technical infrastructure services
* Analyzing how our Products are used
* Conducting research and surveys
* Marketing and promoting our Products

External researchers
--------------------

We provide information to external researchers. They use it to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation, and to promote safety, security and integrity.

Research goals include supporting:

* Our business or mission
* Social good. [Learn more](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/).
* Technological advancement
* Safety and security on our Products
* Public interest
* Health and well-being

When sharing information with external researchers, we ensure the privacy of our users is protected. [Learn more](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Flm.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.fb.com%2Fen-gb%2Fresearchtools%2F) about the privacy-safe research we support.

AI integrations
---------------

Generative AI models that make our features work may not have the most complete or recent information. That means if you ask Meta AI about the score to yesterday's football game, it might not know the right answer. That's why we work with other trusted companies, like search engine providers, so we can bring you the most relevant information.

Meta sometimes shares the messages you send to our AIs and general information, like your region, with these companies so you can get better results. We don't send personally identifying information, like your username, unless you include it in your messages to the AIs.

These companies have their own privacy policies that describe how they use this information we share. [Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/dialog/ai-partners/) in our Generative AI topic in Privacy Center, which includes links to these companies’ privacy policies.

We also share information with other [third parties\[49\]](#annotation-49) in response to legal requests, to comply with applicable law or to prevent harm. [Read the Policy](#10-HowDoWeRespond).

And if we sell or transfer all or part of our business to someone else, in some cases we’ll give the new owner your information as part of that transaction, but only as the law allows.

48

A person, business, organization or body using or integrating our Products to advertise, market or support their products and services

49

A person, business, organization or body that is not part of the Meta Companies

50

For example, a bike shop creates a Page on Facebook and wants to place an ad to reach an audience of people in Atlanta interested in cycling. We determine whether someone fits in this audience based on, for example, whether they liked a Page about bikes. Then people in that audience could see the bike shop's ad.

You can see the “interests” assigned to you in your [Ad preferences](https://accountscenter.facebook.com/ad_preferences/) and remove them if you want.

The bike shop can then see reports showing aggregated statistics about the audience seeing their ads and how their ads are performing. The reports would show statistics to the advertiser that, for example, most of the people who saw or clicked on their ad:

* Were women
* Were between the ages of 25 and 34
* Clicked on the ad from their phone

51

For example, you might request more information from a business by clicking their ad in your Facebook Feed and submitting a form with your name and contact information. Then the advertiser would receive the information you provided.

52

This Policy describes the information we, Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, process to provide [Meta Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/1561485474074139/), which we also call "Products."

53

* Subscribing to premium content
* Buying, selling or using products
* Buying, selling or using services
* Donating to charities

54

Commerce services platforms provide a range of commerce services, including:

* Payments
* Marketing
* Shipping
* Customer engagement tools

55

A third party that creates reports to help advertisers understand how their content and ads are performing. These reports also measure whether people took an action after seeing an ad.

56

A third party that helps market or advertise Meta and our Products, measures the effectiveness of our own marketing campaigns and performs advertising research

How do the Meta Companies work together?
========================================

Highlights
----------

* Meta owns Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Meta Quest and the other Products covered by this Policy
* Meta also owns the Meta Companies, which include WhatsApp
* Sometimes we share information within these Companies
* We do this to make new features or shared experiences between different products.
* We also share information, like your name and email address, to help verify your accounts, and check out suspicious activities. This helps us keep your accounts safe.

We are part of the [Meta Companies](https://www.facebook.com/help/111814505650678) that provide Meta Company Products. [Meta Company Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/195227921252400) include all the [Meta Products\[57\]](#annotation-57) covered by this Policy, plus other products like WhatsApp and more.

We share information we collect, infrastructure, systems and technology with the other Meta Companies. [Learn more](#9-HowDoWeTransfer) about how we transfer information to other countries.

We also process information that we receive about you from other Meta Companies, according to their terms and policies and as permitted by applicable law. In some cases, Meta acts as a [service provider\[58\]](#annotation-58) for other Meta Companies. We act on their behalf and in accordance with their instructions and terms.

Meta Products share information with other Meta Companies:

* To promote safety, security and integrity and comply with applicable laws
* To provide optional features and integrations
* To understand how people use and interact with Meta Company Products

[See some examples\[59\]](#annotation-59) of why we share.

This Policy describes the information we, Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, process to provide [Meta Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/1561485474074139/), which we also call "Products."

58

A person, business, organization or body that provides services to Meta or to our users on behalf of Meta. For example, our service providers do things like investigate suspicious activity and provide customer support.

59

### Promoting safety, security and integrity and complying with applicable law

For example, we share information with Meta Companies that provide financial products and services to help them promote safety, security and integrity and comply with applicable law. This includes:

* Complying with their legal obligations
* Helping keep you and others safe
* Performing account verification
* Investigating suspicious activities
* Creating analytics

For these purposes, we might share your name, email address, who you’re friends with and other account information within the Meta Companies.

### Developing and providing features and integrations

For example, where available in your country, you can choose to use certain integrations that connect your WhatsApp experiences with other Meta Company Products. These integrations let you do things like:

* Use your Meta Pay account to pay for things on WhatsApp
* Chat with your friends on other Meta Company Products, such as smart glasses, by connecting your WhatsApp account

We also share information with Meta Companies to support innovation. For example, your videos can help train our products to recognize objects, like trees, or activities, like when a dog chases a ball. They can also help train tools that let people and businesses create content, like images and videos. This technology is used to help us offer new products or features in the future.

### Understanding how people use our products

We count the number of unique users, monthly active users and daily active users on our products. This information helps us understand the community using our products and publicly share important trends about how our products are used.

You can [object](https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/367438723733209) to our processing your information when we rely on legitimate interests or perform a task in the public interest. We will consider several factors when assessing an objection, including:

* Our users' reasonable expectations
* The benefits and risks to you, us, other users or [third parties\[61\]](#annotation-61)
* Other available means to achieve the same purpose that may be less invasive and do not require disproportionate effort

Unless we find that we have compelling legitimate grounds for this processing which are not outweighed by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms, or the processing is needed for legal reasons, your objection will be upheld. In that case, we will cease processing your information.

How long do we keep your information?
=====================================

Highlights
----------

* We keep information for as long as we need it to provide a feature or service
* But you can request that we delete your information
* We’ll delete that information unless we have to keep it for something else, like for legal reasons

We keep information as long as we need it to provide our Products, comply with legal obligations or protect our or other’s interests. We decide how long we need information on a case-by-case basis. Here’s what we consider when we decide:

* If we need it to operate or provide our Products. For example, we need to keep some of your information to maintain your account. [Learn more\[62\]](#annotation-62).
* The feature we use it for, and how that feature works. For example, messages sent using Messenger’s vanish mode are retained for less time than regular messages. [Learn more\[63\]](#annotation-63).
* How long we need to retain the information to comply with certain legal obligations. [See some examples\[64\]](#annotation-64).
* If we need it for other legitimate purposes, such as to prevent harm; investigate possible violations of our terms or policies; promote safety, security and integrity; or protect ourselves, including our rights, property or products

In some instances and for specific reasons, we’ll keep information for an extended period of time. [Read our Policy\[65\]](#annotation-65) about when we may preserve your information.

62

For example, we keep profile information, photos you’ve posted (and not deleted) and security information for the lifetime of your account.

And when you search for something on Facebook, we keep your search history until you clear the search in your [activity log](https://www.facebook.com/0/allactivity) or delete your account. Once you clear a search or delete your account, it will no longer be visible to you, and it will be [deleted\[66\]](#annotation-66).

But even if you don’t clear your search or delete your account, within six months of your search we delete information about that search that isn’t necessary to show you your search history, like information about the device you were using, or your location.

63

The feature we use it for, and how that feature works
-----------------------------------------------------

For example, May is planning a surprise party for Yang. She sends Cynthia the party details in Messenger using vanish mode so that the message will disappear. The message will no longer be visible to May once she leaves the chat, and Cynthia will see the message only the first time she opens the chat thread.

After Cynthia reads the message, the content is deleted after one hour. If Cynthia never reads it, it’s deleted after 14 days.

64

For example, we retain information for as long as we need it for:

* A legal request or obligation, including obligations of Meta Companies or to comply with applicable law
* A governmental investigation

To delete your information, you can:

* **Find and delete specific information.** We offer tools you can use to delete certain information. For example, you can use Delete buttons to delete content you’ve posted to your account. You can also use tools like [activity log](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/logging/?target=POLICY_PLATFORM_LINK_COLLECTION%3AACTIVITY_LOG&element=privacy_policy_inline_text&containing_element_id=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A6.ex.2-DeleteYourInformationOr&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F0%2Fallactivity%2F%3Fentry_point%3Dprivacy_center%26should_load_landing_page%3D1) on Facebook to send content to the trash in bulk. When you delete content, it’s no longer visible to other users. Visit the [Facebook Help Center](https://www.facebook.com/help/356107851084108) or [Instagram Help Center](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Flm.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F711062676142607) to learn what happens when you delete your content or move it to [trash](https://www.facebook.com/help/3094200253964092).
* **Permanently delete your account.** If you delete your account on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/help/224562897555674) or [Instagram](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Flm.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F370452623149242), we delete your information, including the things you’ve posted, such as your photos and status updates, unless we need to keep it as described in ["How long do we keep your information?"](#8-HowLongDoWe) Once your account is [permanently deleted](https://www.facebook.com/help/250563911970368/?ref=dp) you won’t be able to reactivate it, and you won’t be able to retrieve information, including content you’ve posted.

### To comply with applicable law

For example, we preserve certain information about purchases or transactions associated with an account, in line with Meta’s accounting obligations.

### For safety, security and integrity purposes

For example, if we disable an account for violating our terms or policies, we preserve information about that user to prevent them from opening a new account.

We also might preserve some of your account information as part of our review of suspicious activity. This includes any suspicious activity associated with our financial products, like suspected money laundering or terrorist funding.

### For litigation

How do we transfer information?
===============================

Highlights
----------

* Because we connect people all around the world, we need to transfer information all around the world, too
* When we do this, we follow international regulations to keep your information safe

Why is information transferred to other countries?
--------------------------------------------------

We share the [information we collect](#1-WhatInformationDoWe) globally, both internally across our offices and data centers, and externally with our [partners\[68\]](#annotation-68), [measurement vendors\[69\]](#annotation-69), [service providers\[70\]](#annotation-70) and other [third parties\[71\]](#annotation-71). Because Meta is global, with users, partners and employees around the world, transfers are necessary for a variety of reasons, including:

* So we can operate and provide the services stated in the terms of the [Meta Product\[72\]](#annotation-72) you’re using and this Policy. This includes allowing you to share information and connect with your family and friends around the globe.
* So we can fix, analyze and improve our Products

Where is information transferred?
---------------------------------

Information controlled by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited will be transferred or transmitted to, or stored and processed in:

* Places we have infrastructure or data centers, including the United States, Ireland, Denmark and Sweden, among others
* Countries where Meta Company Products are available
* Other countries where our partners, vendors, service providers and other third parties are located outside of the country where you live, for purposes as described in this Policy

How do we safeguard your information?
-------------------------------------

We rely on [appropriate mechanisms\[73\]](#annotation-73) for international data transfers.

We also make sure that appropriate safeguards are in place whenever we transfer your information. For example, we encrypt your information when it’s in transit over public networks to protect it from unauthorized access.

| Protecting the vital interests of you and/or those of another person: We apply automated processing techniques, conduct manual (human) review and share information, including with law enforcement and others, in circumstances where someone’s vital interests require protection, such as in the case of emergencies.

Our ads system works in the following way:

* **We use your information to determine the ad interests most relevant to you.** We try to predict your ad interests based on the information we have, including any choices you've made in Ad preferences.
* **Advertisers tell us which audience they want to reach based on who they think will be most interested.** This can include things like age, gender, location where advertisers want to show their ad or interests, such as women, based in Dublin, who like golf.
* **We review the potential ads that we could show you to identify the most relevant ones.** Our ads system automatically reviews all the potential ads where you might fit the audience that advertisers want to reach. For example, you may see potential ads because you match the age range and interest category. We determine which ones to show you based on things like whether it best achieves the advertiser’s goal and is most relevant to you. To do this, we use algorithms and machine learning to order the ads we may show you. We use different factors such as the ad quality, the advertiser's desired audience and budget. We also consider how likely we think it is that you will react to the ad based on things like your activity on Meta Products. [Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/447278887528796).
* **All of this information helps us show you the most relevant ads.** When you see an ad on Meta Products (e.g. in your Facebook Feed), we use this process to choose the most relevant ad to show you.

We share your information with law enforcement, government authorities, Meta Companies and other third parties (including industry peers) when we have a good faith belief it’s necessary to detect, prevent and address a variety of situations, such as:

* Unauthorized use of our Products. [See an example.\[85\]](#annotation-85)
* Violations of our terms and policies. [See an example.\[86\]](#annotation-86)
* Investigating suspicious activity
* Protecting ourselves, including our rights, property, personnel or Products
* Preventing abuse, fraud, or other harmful or illegal activity, on and off our Products
* Protecting you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries
* Emergency situations, such as risk of death or imminent bodily harm

For example, if you unlawfully collect and use Facebook user data, we may share your information to defend ourselves against claims or in litigation.

86

For example, if you post threatening or harmful content, we may share your information across the Meta Companies to protect ourselves and others. This can include blocking your access to certain features or disabling your account across the Meta Companies.
