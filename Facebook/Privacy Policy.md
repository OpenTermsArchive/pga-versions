With integrated partners
------------------------

You can choose to connect with [integrated partners\[48\]](#annotation-48) who use our Products. If you do, these integrated partners receive information about you and your activity.

These integrated partners can always access information that’s public on our Products. Learn more about other information they receive and how they handle your information:

When you use an integrated partner’s product or service
-------------------------------------------------------

Information they receive automatically
--------------------------------------

When you use an integrated partner’s products or services, they can access:

* What you post or share from these products or services
* What you use their services to do
* Information from and about the device you’re using
* The language setting you’ve chosen on our Products

[See examples\[49\]](#annotation-49) of when an integrated partner might receive your information.

Information they receive with your permission
---------------------------------------------

Sometimes these integrated partners ask you for permission to access certain additional information from your Facebook, Instagram or Messenger account. In their request, they’ll explain what information they’d like to access and let you choose whether to share it.

On Facebook, this includes things like your email address, hometown or birthday. On Instagram, this includes content, like photos and videos, that you’ve shared from your account when the account was set to private.

[Learn what happens if you choose to share your friends list, or if your friends choose to share their friends list.\[50\]](#annotation-50)

We automatically log when you receive a request from an integrated partner to access your information. These requests to access information are separate from the Apps and Websites access that you manage in your Facebook or Instagram ad settings or in your mobile device settings.

How long they can access your information
-----------------------------------------

Apps or websites you’ve logged into using Facebook Login or connected to your Instagram account can access your nonpublic information on Meta Products unless it appears to us that you haven’t used the app or website in 90 days. Note that even if an app’s access to your information has expired, it can still retain information you shared with it previously.

We encourage you to visit your Apps and Websites settings from time to time to review which apps and websites continue to have access to your information through Facebook Login or Instagram.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Integrated partners receive information about your activity when you interact with other Facebook, Instagram or Messenger users while they’re using the integrated partner’s product or service.

For example, a gamer livestreams to Facebook using a partner app. Then you comment on that livestream. The app developer will receive information about your comment.

How integrated partners handle your information
-----------------------------------------------

Integrated partners handle the information you share with them according to their own terms and policies, not Meta’s. You can review their privacy policy on their website or app to learn how they receive and process your information.

How do we share information with third parties?
===============================================

Highlights
----------

We share certain information with:

* Advertisers who show ads on our Products
* Businesses we hire to market our Products for us
* Businesses we hire to do things like offer customer service or conduct surveys
* Researchers who use it to do things like innovate, advance technology, or improve people’s safety

We don’t sell your information, and we never will.

We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and we never will. We also require [partners\[52\]](#annotation-52) and other [third parties\[53\]](#annotation-53) to follow rules about how they can and cannot use and disclose the information we provide.

Here’s more detail about who we share information with:

Partners
--------

Advertisers and Audience Network publishers (if we show you ads on Meta Products)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Advertisers

We provide advertisers with reports about the number and kinds of people who see and engage with their ads. These reports include information about the general demographics and interests of people who engaged with an advertiser’s ad. Then advertisers can better understand their audience. [See an example\[54\]](#annotation-54).

Meta also provides advertisers and their vendors with information about:

* Ads people engaged with, if any
* When people engaged with ads
* Where that ad was shown (for example, on Instagram, or on Facebook)

We also confirm which ads you viewed that led you to take an action with an advertiser, such as downloading an advertiser's app. But we don't share information with these advertisers and their vendors that by itself can be used to contact or identify you, such as your name or email address, unless you [give us permission.\[55\]](#annotation-55)

### Audience Network publishers and their vendors

Meta Audience Network lets advertisers place ads with us that will be published on other apps and websites outside of Meta.

To help show you ads on their apps and websites, we share information with publishers who use Audience Network, as well as vendors who facilitate that use. For example, we share:

* How many people see and engage with ads on publisher apps
* Information related to or in response to a [publisher’s request](https://www.facebook.com/help/119468292028768?ref=shareable) to serve an ad on its app.

But we don't share information with these publishers and their vendors that by itself can be used to contact or identify you, such as your name or email address, unless you [give us permission\[55\]](#annotation-55).

Partners who use our analytics services
---------------------------------------

People rely on our [Products\[56\]](#annotation-56), like business accounts, professional tools and Facebook Pages, to run and promote their businesses. Businesses use our analytics services to understand more about how people are using their content, features, products and services.

To provide these services, we use the [information we collect](#1-WhatInformationDoWe) about you. We put this information into aggregate reports so that partners can see how well their content, features, products and services are performing and are able to understand things like users’ experience with such content, products and services.

These reports aggregate information like:

* How many people interacted with our partners' content, products or services
* The [general demographics and interests\[54\]](#annotation-54) of the people who interacted with it
* How people use our partners’ products and services to connect to Meta Products and the performance of their connection and networks

Advertisers also receive other information. [Read our policy](#4.subpage.2-AdvertisersAndAudienceNetwork) about how we share information with advertisers.

Partners who offer goods or services on our Products and commerce services platforms
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you choose to [make a transaction\[57\]](#annotation-57), or otherwise choose to share information with a seller, creator, fundraiser, charity, payment services provider or [commerce services platform\[58\]](#annotation-58), we share information with them and with any providers acting on their behalf.

Depending on how you interact with them, they receive:

* Information to complete your transaction, like order, payment, contact and shipping information
* Information to help ensure the security of the transaction, like information about your device or connection
* Any information required by applicable regulation
* Other information you choose to share with them

For example, if you donate to a charity that receives funds through PayPal Giving Fund, your donation will be made to PayPal Giving Fund. The PayPal Giving Fund will receive information such as the transaction amount and name of the charity. Their payment service provider will also receive information needed to facilitate the payment, including your payment card credential information.

Integrated partners
-------------------

When you choose to use integrated partners’ products or services, they may receive information about you and your activity. [Read the policy](#3.subpage.4-WhenYouUseAn).

Vendors
-------

Measurement vendors
-------------------

We don’t create every measurement and analytics report ourselves.

We share information (like whether people saw an ad or engaged with it) with our [measurement vendors\[59\]](#annotation-59), who aggregate it to provide their reports.

For example, an advertiser might ask a measurement vendor to help figure out the impact its ads on Facebook have had on sales. The measurement vendor compares information from us about clicks on the advertiser’s Facebook ads with information from the advertiser about product purchases. Then the measurement vendor creates and provides aggregated reports that show the advertiser how its ads are performing.

Marketing vendors
-----------------

We share information about you with [marketing vendors\[60\]](#annotation-60). For example, we share your device identifier or other identifiers with marketing vendors to help us serve you ads most relevant to your interests.

Marketing vendors support our marketing and advertising efforts by:

* Serving our advertisements across the internet, including on mobile, desktop and connected television devices
* Tracking and categorizing your online and mobile app activity
* Providing us information about your interests and community and advertising interactions

These marketing vendors help us understand who might find our advertising most relevant to their interests, and which of our Products might interest you. This information can be used to personalize which of our ads are shown to you. Marketing vendors also use this information to measure response to our marketing efforts and the effectiveness of our advertising.

Service providers
-----------------

Service providers
-----------------

Service providers provide services to us that help us provide our Products to you. We share the information we have about you to receive these services, which include:

* Investigating suspicious activity
* Detecting and stopping threats to our personnel and property
* Facilitating payments
* Providing customer support
* Improving the functionality of our Products
* Providing technical infrastructure services
* Analyzing how our Products are used
* Conducting research and surveys
* Marketing and promoting our Products

Third parties
-------------

External researchers
--------------------

We provide information to external researchers. They use it to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation, and to promote safety, security and integrity.

Research goals include supporting:

* Our business or mission
* Social good. [Learn more](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/).
* Technological advancement
* Safety and security on our Products
* Public interest
* Health and well-being

When sharing information with external researchers, we ensure the privacy of our users is protected. [Learn more](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Flm.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.fb.com%2Fen-gb%2Fresearchtools%2F) about the privacy-safe research we support.

Other third parties
-------------------

We also share information with other [third parties\[53\]](#annotation-53) in response to legal requests, to comply with applicable law or to prevent harm. [Read the policy](#10-HowDoWeRespond).

And if we sell or transfer all or part of our business to someone else, in some cases we’ll give the new owner your information as part of that transaction, but only as the law allows.

========================================

----------

* Meta also owns the Meta Companies, which include WhatsApp
* Sometimes we share information within these Companies
* We do this to make new features or shared experiences between different products.

We share information we collect, infrastructure, systems and technology with the other Meta Companies. [Learn more](#9-HowDoWeTransfer) about how we transfer information to other countries.

We also process information that we receive about you from other Meta Companies, according to their terms and policies and as permitted by applicable law. In some cases, Meta acts as a [service provider\[63\]](#annotation-63) for other Meta Companies. We act on their behalf and in accordance with their instructions and terms.

Why we share across the Meta Companies
--------------------------------------

Meta Products share information with other Meta Companies:

* To promote safety, security and integrity and comply with applicable laws
* To provide optional features and integrations
* To understand how people use and interact with Meta Company Products

How long do we keep your information?
=====================================

Highlights
----------

* We keep information for as long as we need it to provide a feature or service
* But you can request that we delete your information
* We’ll delete that information unless we have to keep it for something else, like for legal reasons

We keep information as long as we need it to provide our Products, comply with legal obligations or protect our or other’s interests. We decide how long we need information on a case-by-case basis. Here’s what we consider when we decide:

* If we need it to operate or provide our Products. For example, we need to keep some of your information to maintain your account. [Learn more\[69\]](#annotation-69).
* The feature we use it for, and how that feature works. For example, messages sent using Messenger’s vanish mode are retained for less time than regular messages. [Learn more\[70\]](#annotation-70).
* How long we need to retain the information to comply with certain legal obligations. [See some examples\[71\]](#annotation-71).
* If we need it for other legitimate purposes, such as to prevent harm; investigate possible violations of our terms or policies; promote safety, security and integrity; or protect ourselves, including our rights, property or products

In some instances and for specific reasons, we’ll keep information for an extended period of time. [Read our policy\[72\]](#annotation-72) about when we may preserve your information.

[Return to top](#)

How do we transfer information?
===============================

Highlights
----------

* Because we connect people all around the world, we need to transfer information all around the world, too
* When we do this, we follow international regulations to keep your information safe

Why is information transferred to other countries?
--------------------------------------------------

We share the [information we collect](#1-WhatInformationDoWe) globally, both internally across our offices and data centers, and externally with our [partners\[75\]](#annotation-75), [measurement vendors\[76\]](#annotation-76), [service providers\[77\]](#annotation-77) and other [third parties\[78\]](#annotation-78). Because Meta is global, with users, partners and employees around the world, transfers are necessary for a variety of reasons, including:

* So we can operate and provide the services stated in the terms of the [Meta Product\[79\]](#annotation-79) you’re using and this Policy. This includes allowing you to share information and connect with your family and friends around the globe.
* So we can fix, analyze and improve our Products

Where is information transferred?
---------------------------------

Information controlled by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited will be transferred or transmitted to, or stored and processed in:

* Places we have infrastructure or data centers, including the United States, Ireland, Denmark and Sweden, among others
* Countries where Meta Company Products are available
* Other countries where our partners, vendors, service providers and other third parties are located outside of the country where you live, for purposes as described in this Policy

How do we safeguard your information?
-------------------------------------

We rely on [appropriate mechanisms\[80\]](#annotation-80) for international data transfers.

We also make sure that appropriate safeguards are in place whenever we transfer your information. For example, we encrypt your information when it’s in transit over public networks to protect it from unauthorized access.
