1\. The services we provide
===========================

Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. To help advance this mission, we provide the Products described below to you:

1.1 Provide, personalize and improve our Products:
--------------------------------------------------

Your experience on Facebook is unique to you and unlike anyone else's: from the posts, stories, events, ads (if we show you ads on Meta Products) and other content you see in Facebook Feed or our video platform to the Facebook Pages you follow and other features you might use, such as Facebook Marketplace, and search. For example, we use information about the connections you make, the choices and settings you select, and what you share and do on and off our Products to personalize your experience.

For more information about how we use information to provide you with a personalised experience, please review our .

We help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organizations and others that matter to you across the Meta Products you use, and (if you choose to engage with people on a third party’s products) third party products. We use the information we have to make suggestions for you – for example, groups to join, events to attend, Facebook Pages to follow or send a message to, shows to watch and people you may want to become friends with. Stronger ties make for better communities, and we believe that our Products are most useful when people are connected to people, groups and organizations that they care about. We want the content and suggestions that you see on Facebook to be as interesting and valuable to you as possible. Please see our for information on how our various recommender systems prioritize signals to determine which content and suggestions to show you, as well as options for customizing your experience.

To help you discover content, products and services that may interest you, we show you offers and other sponsored or commercial content to help you discover content, products and services that are offered by the many businesses and organizations that use Facebook and other Meta Products.

Section 2 below explains this in more detail.

Our Products provide many ways to express yourself or communicate with friends, family, and others about what matters to you - for example, sharing status updates, photos, videos, and stories across the Meta Products (consistent with your settings), sending messages or making voice or video calls to a friend or several people, creating events or groups, or adding content to your profile as well as showing you insights on how others engage with your content. We have also developed, and continue to explore, new ways for people to use technology, such as augmented reality and 360 video to create and share more expressive and engaging content on Meta Products.

We engage in research to develop, test and improve our Products. This includes analyzing information that we have about our users, and understanding how people use our Products, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features. We use and develop advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning systems and augmented reality so that people can use our Products safely regardless of physical ability or geographic location. For example, technology such as this helps people who have visual impairments understand what or who is in photos or videos shared on Facebook. We also build sophisticated network and communication technology to help more people connect to the Internet in areas with limited access. And we develop automated systems to improve our ability to protect our community and our Products.

For more information about how we use your information to provide, develop and improve Meta Products, please review our .

1.2 Promote the safety, security, and integrity of our Products, combat harmful conduct and keep our community of users safe:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

People will only build community on Meta Products if they feel safe and secure. We work hard to maintain the security (including the availability, authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality) of our Products and services. We employ dedicated teams around the world, work with external service providers, partners and other relevant entities, and develop advanced technical systems to detect potential misuse of our Products, harmful conduct towards others, and situations where we may be able to help support or protect our community, including to respond to user reports of potentially violating content. If we learn of content or conduct like this, we will take appropriate action that may include notifying you, offering help, removing or restricting content, removing or restricting access to certain features, disabling an account, or contacting law enforcement. Learn more about the restrictions we may impose on the use of Facebook, including information on how we apply our content policies, procedures, measures and tools . We share information data with other when we detect misuse or harmful conduct by someone using one of our Products or to help keep Meta Products, users and the community safe. For example, we share information with Meta Companies that provide financial products and services to help them promote safety, security and integrity and comply with applicable law. Meta may access, preserve, use and share any information it collects about you where it has a good faith belief it is required or permitted by law to do so. For more information, please review our .

In some cases, the Oversight Board may review our decisions, subject to its terms and bylaws. Learn more [here](https://www.oversightboard.com/).

1.3 Provide consistent and seamless experiences across the Meta Company Products, outside of our contract with you:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We design our systems so that your experience is consistent and seamless across the different that you use depending on your choices. For example, we use information about the people you engage with on Facebook to make it easier for you to connect with them on Messenger, and we enable you to communicate with a business you follow on Facebook through Messenger.

1.4 Communicating with you:
---------------------------

We may need to send you communications, like emails or in-product notices, to respond to you or inform you about any product-related issues, research, or our terms and policies. For more information, please review our .

1.5 Ensuring access to our Products:
------------------------------------

To operate our global services and enable you to connect with people around the world, we need to transfer, store and distribute content and data to our data centers, partners, service providers, vendors and systems around the world, including outside your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Products. This infrastructure may be owned, operated, or controlled by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, or its affiliates. For more information about how we transfer, store or process your information, please review our .

2\. How our services are funded
===============================

You can choose to use our Products for free with ads or to subscribe to use without ads:

* If you choose to use our Products for free with ads, you allow us to show you ads that businesses and organizations pay us to promote on and off the Meta Products.
* If you choose to subscribe to use our Products without ads, you won’t see ads from us and we do not use your data for ads. The details of price, currency and payment period for the subscription for no ads will be provided to you before you complete your purchase.

Protecting people's privacy is central to how we've designed our ads system. If we show you ads on Meta Products, we show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal information and we don't share information that directly identifies you (such as your name, email address or other contact information) with advertisers unless you give us specific permission. Instead, we allow advertisers to tell us things like their business goal, and the kind of audience they want to see their ads (for example, people between the age of 18-35 who live close to the advertiser’s store in Portugal). We then show their ad to people who we think might find it relevant.

We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Meta Products. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We don’t share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Meta ads work .

You can learn about how we collect and use your information in our , including more detail on the different types of information we use to show you ads (if we show you ads on Meta Products). You have controls over the types of ads and advertisers you see, and the types of information we use to determine which ads we show you. .

3.2 What you can share and do on Meta Products
----------------------------------------------

We want people to use Meta Products to express themselves and to share content that is important to them, but not at the expense of the safety and well-being of others or the integrity of our community.

In addition, if you breach these provisions, we may, without prejudice of our termination right under Section 4.2, restrict your use of certain features of Facebook including, without limitation, creating content, such as posting, commenting, using Facebook Live or creating a Facebook Page for a limited period of time. The kind and extent of such restrictions will depend on the severity of your breach and the number and nature of previous breaches. We will notify you of this and the reason why. If you disagree with the intended restriction, you can request a review before the restriction comes into effect. If you request a review, you will receive a notification of our final decision.

A notification of the removal or blocking or restriction of content or the restriction of use of an account, including details on the reason, the possibility to request a review, and, if applicable, the kind and duration of the limitation, will not be provided if and as long as we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. It will also not be provided if and as long as the notification would be unreasonable, taking into account the interests of both parties.

We work with independent fact-checkers in many jurisdictions to combat misinformation. When content has been rated by fact-checkers, we may add a notice to provide additional context. You can find more information about fact-checking .

**1\. Your content:** You retain ownership of the content that you create and share on Facebook and other you use, and nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own content.

**2\. Permission to use content you create and share:** Specifically, when you share, post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) on or in connection with our Products, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, and worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your and settings). This license is only for the purpose of making our Products available to you. This means, for example, that if you share a photo on Facebook, you give us permission to store, copy, and share it with others (again, consistent with your settings) such as Meta Products or service providers that support those products and services you use.

If you send content to trash, the deletion process will automatically begin in 30 days unless you choose to delete the content sooner. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.

Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:

* where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
* where immediate deletion would restrict our ability to:
    * investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our Products or systems);
    * protect the safety, integrity, and security of our Products, systems, services, and users, and to defend ourselves;

As a result, we may need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect our services and practices to promote a safe and secure experience on our Products and services, and/or to comply with applicable law. We will only make any changes if the provisions are no longer appropriate or if they are incomplete, and only if the changes are reasonable for you in consideration of your interests or if the changes are required for safety and security purposes or to comply with applicable law.

We will notify you (for example, by email or through our Products) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect, unless the changes are required by law. We will inform you about this 30 day period and its importance in our notification. Once any updated Terms are in effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to access or use our Products.

-------------------------------------

We want Facebook to be a place where people feel welcome and safe to express themselves and share their thoughts and ideas.

Good cause is specifically if a party violates obligations under these Terms, any laws, third party rights, or privacy policies, and the terminating party cannot be expected to continue the contractual relationship under consideration of all circumstances of the individual case and having weighed the interests of both parties up until the agreed time of termination or the expiry of a period of notice. A termination for good cause is possible only within a reasonable time frame after becoming aware of the violation.

If the good cause is a breach of an obligation of these Terms, termination is permitted only after an unsuccessful granted cure duty has expired, or after an unsuccessful warning. However, a time limit for remedy and a warning are not necessary if the other side refuses to fulfill their obligations seriously and with finality or if special circumstances justify an immediate termination, having weighed the interests of both parties.

Without limiting any of the above, we shall be liable for slight negligence only in the case of violation of an "essential" obligation under this agreement. "Essential" obligations in this sense are obligations necessary for the fulfillment of the agreement, the breach of which would jeopardize the purpose of the agreement in question, and which you can trust to be complied with. In these cases, liability is limited to typical and foreseeable damages; in other cases, there is no liability for slight negligence.

4.4 Disputes
------------
