M. California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA)
=================================================

These rules apply solely to all visitors, users, and others who are residents of the State of California (“California residents”). We adopt these rules to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) and any terms defined in the CCPA have the same meaning when used here. Where noted, the CCPA temporarily exempts Personal Information reflecting a written or verbal business-to-business communication (“B2B personal information”) from some of its requirements.

California residents have the right to request that we disclose what Personal Information we collect, use, disclose, and sell (if applicable). Our uses of Personal Information and instructions for submitting a verifiable Consumer request for such disclosures are detailed further below.

**1\. Information We Collect**

In particular, we collected the following categories (A, B, and F), as defined in the CCPA, of Personal Information from our Consumers within the last twelve (12) months:

**2\. We obtain the categories of Personal Information listed above from the following categories of sources:**

* Directly from California residents. For example, from forms California residents complete, documents or information California residents provide us as part of a transaction or inquiry, or products and services California residents obtain from us;
* Indirectly from California residents. For example, from observing Consumers’ actions on our Website or App; or
* From third parties or service providers that you have authorized to receive and share Personal Information.

**3\. Use of Personal Information for Commercial Purposes.**

We may use or disclose personal information we collect for "business purposes" or "commercial purposes" (as defined under the CCPA), which may include the following examples:

* To fulfill or meet the reason a Consumer provided the information. For example, if a Consumer shares his or her name and contact information to set up an Account or profile on our Website or App or to ask a question about our products or services, we will use that Personal Information to respond to his or her inquiry.
* To provide, support, personalize, and develop our Website, App, products, and services.

We will not collect additional categories of Personal Information or use the Personal Information we collected for materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes without providing you notice.

**4\. Sharing Personal Information.**

We may disclose Consumers’ Personal Information to a third party for a business purpose. When we disclose Personal Information for a business purpose, we enter into a contract that describes the purpose and requires the recipient to both keep that Personal Information confidential and not use it for any purpose except for performing the contract. The CCPA prohibits third parties who purchase the Personal Information we hold from reselling it unless you have received explicit notice and an opportunity to opt-out of further sales.

We may share Consumers’ Personal Information for a business purpose to the following categories of third parties:

* service providers;
* advertising and marketing companies (as disclosed in our Privacy Policy);

* Category F: Internet or other similar network activity

**5\. Sales of Personal Information**

In the preceding twelve (12) months, we have not sold Personal Information.

**6\. Sale of Personal Information of Minors Under 16 Years of Age**

We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from minors under the age of 16 through our Website or App, although certain third party websites that we link to may do so. These third-party websites have their own terms of use and privacy policies, and we encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's internet usage and instruct their children to never provide information on other websites without their permission.

At this time, we do not sell the Personal Information of Consumers, including Consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age.

If a Consumer has reason to believe that a minor under the age of 16 has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us with sufficient detail to enable us to delete that information.
