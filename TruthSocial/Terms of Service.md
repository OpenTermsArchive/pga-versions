We will alert you about any changes by updating the "Last updated" date of these Terms of Service, and you waive any right to receive specific notice of each such change except herein or on the Site or Apps.

It is your responsibility to periodically review these Terms of Service to stay informed of updates.

The Service is intended for users who are at least 18 years of age.
