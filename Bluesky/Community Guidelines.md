Community Guidelines
====================

#### Last Updated: September 19, 2025

Bluesky is a social networking application provided by Bluesky Social, PBC ("**we**", "**us**", "**our**”). Bluesky runs on the Authenticated Transfer Protocol ("**AT Protocol**"), a decentralized social networking protocol that supports many different kinds of services. Together with the Bluesky [Terms of Service](https://bsky.social/about/support/tos), [Privacy Policy](https://bsky.social/about/support/privacy-policy), and [Copyright Policy](https://bsky.social/about/support/copyright), these Community Guidelines ("**Guidelines**") govern your use of the Bluesky application, website, and services (collectively, "**Bluesky**"). By accessing or using Bluesky, you agree to be bound by these Guidelines. Please read them carefully.

These Guidelines only apply to social networking that happens on Bluesky. If you’re using another social networking application on the AT Protocol that isn’t Bluesky Social (a “**Developer Application**”), the terms and conditions of that Developer Application will govern your experience. We are not responsible for the content or practices of Developer Applications.

Our mission is to build technologies for open and decentralized public conversation. We want to foster a vibrant and evolving community that respects individual preferences and adapts to the changing needs of our users. These guidelines are part of your agreement with us and set out some rules for using Bluesky.

We drafted these guidelines to comply with applicable laws and to do three things:

1. Empower user choice: We strive to make choices on Bluesky that align with your personal preferences and values. To do this, we try to make it easy for people to run their own apps, to choose the algorithms that power their feeds, and to migrate between services.
2. Cultivate a welcoming environment: We want to create a safe and friendly space where users feel welcomed, supported, and enjoy participating.
3. Evolve with feedback: As we evolve, our guidelines and standards will, too. We will regularly review and update these guidelines in response to your feedback, emerging trends, and changing laws.

Unless they are otherwise defined in these Community Guidelines, all capitalized terms have the meaning given to them in the Bluesky Terms of Service. Throughout these Guidelines, the terms "including," "includes," "such as," and "for example" mean "without limitation."

Bluesky Community Guidelines
----------------------------

These Guidelines promote a safe and enjoyable experience for everyone. We moderate content on Bluesky Social using human moderators, working alongside automated systems, and we provide customizable options to help you shape your experience.

Our approach to content moderation is grounded in respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, while recognizing that we must follow the law in different jurisdictions. We use proportional enforcement actions that prioritize community safety while preserving space for legitimate expression and open dialogue.

We recognize that no single company can get online safety right for every country, culture, and community, which is why we've built a composable moderation infrastructure that lets you create or subscribe to additional labeling services based on your preferences. This approach gives communities the power to create their own moderation tools alongside our baseline protections. You can learn more about composable moderation in this [blog post](https://bsky.social/about/blog/03-12-2024-stackable-moderation).

While communities can build their own moderation tools, we remain responsible for setting and enforcing baseline rules that require careful judgment. That means we make difficult decisions every day about whether certain types of content or expression cross into becoming harassment or other prohibited conduct. We always use our best efforts when making these determinations, and our appeals process gives you an opportunity to tell us if you think we have gotten something wrong. Ultimately, however, this discretion rests with us, and we reserve the right to make final decisions about how to handle any specific piece of content or account. You can learn more about our enforcement procedures and appeals process in our [Terms of Service](https://bsky.social/about/support/tos).

Our Principles:

3. Be Authentic: We do not allow content intended to misrepresent, defraud, trick, deceive, or mislead.
