Community Guidelines
====================

#### Last Updated: 14 August 2025

_These Community Guidelines were updated on 14 August 2025 and shared for community comment. The official update will be published on 15 September and will take effect on 15 October._

_You may find the previous version of our Community Guidelines [here](https://bsky.social/about/support/community-guidelines-deprecated)._

Bluesky is a social networking application provided by Bluesky Social, PBC ("**we**", "**us**", "**our**”). Bluesky runs on the Authenticated Transfer Protocol ("**AT Protocol**"), a decentralized social networking protocol that supports many different kinds of services. Together with the Bluesky [Terms of Service](https://bsky.social/about/support/tos), [Privacy Policy](https://bsky.social/about/support/privacy-policy), and [Copyright Policy](https://bsky.social/about/support/copyright), these Community Guidelines ("**Guidelines**") govern your use of the Bluesky application, website, and services (collectively, "**Bluesky**"). By accessing or using Bluesky, you agree to be bound by these Guidelines. Please read them carefully.

These Guidelines only apply to social networking that happens on Bluesky. If you’re using another social networking application on the AT Protocol that isn’t Bluesky Social (a “**Developer Application**”), the terms and conditions of that Developer Application will govern your experience. We are not responsible for the content or practices of Developer Applications.

Our mission is to build technologies for open and decentralized public conversation. We want to foster a vibrant and evolving community that respects individual preferences and adapts to the changing needs of our users. These guidelines are part of your agreement with us and set out some rules for using Bluesky.

We drafted these guidelines with the following three principles in mind, while making sure to comply with applicable legal requirements:

1. Empower user choice: We strive to make choices on Bluesky that align with your personal preferences and values. To do this, we try to make it easy for people to run their own apps, to choose the algorithms that power their feeds, and to migrate between services.
2. Cultivate a welcoming environment: We want to create a safe and friendly space where users feel welcomed, supported, and enjoy participating.
3. Evolve with feedback: As we evolve, our guidelines and standards will, too. We will regularly review and update these guidelines in response to your feedback, emerging trends, and changing laws.

Bluesky Community Guidelines
----------------------------

We take seriously our responsibility to Bluesky users. These Guidelines are designed to promote a safe and enjoyable experience. To achieve this goal, we moderate the content on Bluesky Social using our discretion, and we have created ways for you to adjust content filters within the App based on your preferences.

Unless they are otherwise defined in these Community Guidelines, all capitalized terms have the meaning given to them in the [Bluesky Terms of Service](https://bsky.social/about/support/tos). Throughout these Guidelines, the terms "including," "includes," "such as," and "for example" mean "without limitation."

1\. The Cardinal Directions
---------------------------

1. Safety First. We do not allow content that shows or promotes violence or harm–to adults, children, or animals. Do not violate anyone's privacy or share their personal information.
2. Respect Others. We do not allow content that promotes or that is hate speech, harassment, bullying, or discrimination.
3. Be Authentic. We do not allow content intended to misrepresent, defraud, trick, deceive, or mislead.
4. Follow the Rules. We do not allow content that is illegal. This includes content that is prohibited by laws about online content, intellectual property, copyright, trade, commerce, cybersecurity, data protection. Do not try to avoid our moderation controls, either.

If you violate these Guidelines, we may hide, remove or label your content, or we may suspend or terminate your account, permanently ban you from the platform, or–in extreme cases–make a report to the appropriate authorities.

6\. Reporting
-------------

We rely on the entire community (developers, creators, users, visitors) to enforce our community guidelines. The reporting system built into the App and available online or the in-app feedback form helps us detect violations of the Bluesky Community Guidelines. More information about reporting can be found on our [Support](https://bsky.social/about/support) page.

1. User Violations of Bluesky Community Guidelines. You can report suspected violations of the Community Guidelines by reporting posts, accounts, or direct messages with the in-app reporting feature. Our [Terms of Service](https://bsky.social/about/support/tos) explain our Complaints and Appeals process.
2. Developer Violations of Bluesky Terms. To report an app or service that you believe is not complying with or enforcing these Guidelines or the Bluesky [Terms of Service](https://bsky.social/about/support/tos) or [Privacy Policy](https://bsky.social/about/support/privacy-policy), please email Bluesky at [support@bsky.app](mailto:support@bsky.app).
3. App-Specific Guidelines. Developers of apps and operators of services may establish their own standards, separate from these Guidelines. These services may temporarily or permanently ban violators from their apps or services. To report violations of a third-party app or service's standard of conduct, please contact the developer or provider of the third-party app or service. Bluesky Social cannot enforce the standards of conduct of third-party apps or services.

7\. Bluesky Labeler Guidelines
------------------------------

Labels help the Bluesky community to control their experience by contributing content classifications. The people and organizations operating labeling services should work for the overall benefit and safety of the Bluesky community.

1. Do:
    1. Keep labels straightforward and non-abusive.
    2. Provide labeling guidance that is impartial and based on clear, observable content and behavior.
    3. Apply labels impartially, ethically, and consistently. The less bias you have when applying a label, the more trust that users can have in your labeling service.
    4. Be upfront about what you're labeling, why, and how, to help users decide whether to rely on your judgments.
    5. Consider proportionate interventions when applying labels. Use a scalpel, not a sledgehammer. In general, it's best to start by labeling content before labeling an entire account.
    6. Should you choose manual moderation, accept reports against the labeling parameters you have designed, assign labels, and review appeals in a timely manner.
2. Do not:
    1. Use labels in a way that is abusive, harassing, or targeting of specific accounts, groups, or protected characteristics.
    2. Design labels that use profanity, spurious allegations, derogatory terms, or harmful tags.
    3. Label maliciously (i.e. knowingly mischaracterizing content as harmful or problematic when it plainly does not go against your stated policies or guidelines)
    4. Accept compensation for specific labeling actions - or attempt to extort individuals to have labels applied or removed.
    5. Claim to represent Bluesky or to show false affiliation with other entities.
    6. Deploy labeling services in a way that undermines Bluesky's network stability.
    7. Use labeling accounts or services to evade moderation or blocks on your main account, or deploy labels in an attempt to do so.

Violations of this guidance may result in remediations such as deletion of labels, temporary or permanent suspension of accounts, and steps up to and including disassociating your labeling service from Bluesky Social.

8\. Bluesky Developer Guidelines

Developers should keep records of all reports of violations and their responses, and Bluesky may at any time request such data to ensure compliance with its policies.

We may update these Guidelines periodically. We will always post the revised version here and we will notify you through the App, website, or other communication channel if we make any material changes.
