YouTube channel monetization policies
=====================================

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/3gqynDEORpTmOvDwv156D69K5bcKgUCq3UcV)

**July 15, 2025:** We’re making a minor update to our “repetitious content” policy to better clarify this includes content that is repetitive or mass-produced. We are also renaming this policy from  “repetitious content” to “inauthentic content.” This type of content has always been ineligible for monetization under our existing policies, where creators are rewarded for original and authentic content. There is no change to our reused content policy which reviews content like commentary, clips, compilations, and reaction videos.

**March 10, 2025:** We’re making improvements to our ad suitability review process. As a result, videos undergoing checks (including private videos) may receive an additional review that may be completed by a human. In some cases, video monetization decisions may take up to 24 hours. This update is designed to improve the accuracy of monetization decisions and increase your channel’s overall monetization potential. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/16271309).

**March 3, 2022:** Due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, we will be temporarily pausing Google and YouTube ads from serving to users located in Russia. Also, we are pausing access to all monetization features (such as Channel Memberships, Super Chat, Super Stickers, and Merch) for viewers in Russia. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10008196).

If you’re monetizing on YouTube, it’s important that your channel follows YouTube monetization policies. These include policies described below, as well as YouTube’s [Community Guidelines](https://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines), [Terms of Service](https://www.youtube.com/static?template=terms), [Copyright](https://www.youtube.com/about/copyright/#support-and-troubleshooting), [Rights Clearance Adjustment policies](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/12496325), and our [program policies](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/48182?ctx=checklist).

These policies apply to anyone in, or looking to apply to, the YouTube Partner Program. The [YouTube Shorts monetization policies](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/12504220) also apply if you’re monetizing Shorts on YouTube.

All content monetizing with ads must follow our [advertiser-friendly content guidelines](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6162278). To earn revenue from fan funding features, first time users must accept the Commerce Product Module (CPM) before turning on the individual features. You must also follow the [Commerce Products monetization policies](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/13195878) when monetizing with fan funding features.

Here’s a quick overview of each major policy. Make sure you read each policy thoroughly, as these policies are used to check if a channel is suitable to monetize. Our reviewers regularly check to see whether monetizing channels follow these policies. [Learn more about how we enforce our policies](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1311392#enforcement).

Keep in mind that when we use the term **video** on this page, it refers to Shorts, long-form videos, and live streaming. These policies apply wherever videos are viewed including the Watch Page (pages within YouTube, YouTube Music, or YouTube Kids), the YouTube Video Player (player that embeds YouTube content on other sites), and the YouTube Shorts Player (player that makes Shorts available).

What we check when we review your channel
-----------------------------------------

If you’re [making money on YouTube](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/72857), your content should be original and "authentic." This means that we expect your content to:

*   Be your original creation. If you borrow content from someone else, you need to change it significantly to make it your own.
*   Not be mass-produced or repetitive. It should be made for the enjoyment or education of viewers, rather than for the sole purpose of getting views.

Our reviewers will check your channel and content against our policies. Since they can’t check every video, our reviewers may focus on your channel’s:

*   Main theme
*   Most viewed videos
*   Newest videos
*   Biggest proportion of watch time
*   Video metadata (including titles, thumbnails, and descriptions)
*   Channel’s “About” section

The above are just examples of content our reviewers may assess. Note that our reviewers can, and may check other parts of your channel to see whether it fully meets our policies.

Follow the YouTube Community Guidelines
---------------------------------------

These guidelines help keep YouTube a great community for viewers, creators, and advertisers. Anyone on YouTube needs to follow our Community Guidelines, and any content you post must follow all our [Community Guidelines](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9288567).

Monetizing creators should know that these guidelines apply not only to individual videos, but also to your channel overall. Content that violates YouTube’s [Community Guidelines](https://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines) is not eligible for monetization and will be removed from YouTube.

Follow our program policies

AdSense for YouTube allows YouTube partners to get paid for monetizing their videos. Make sure to follow our [program policies](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/48182?ctx=checklist) and YouTube’s [Terms of Service](https://www.youtube.com/static?template=terms).

### Inauthentic Content

Inauthentic content refers to mass-produced or repetitive content. This includes content that looks like it’s made with a template with little to no variation across videos, or content that’s easily replicable at scale.

This policy applies to your channel as a whole. In other words, if you have videos that violate our guidelines, monetization may be removed from your entire channel.

#### What is allowed to monetize

This policy makes sure monetized content offers viewers something appealing and interesting to watch. In other words, if the average viewer can clearly tell that content on your channel differs from video to video, it's fine to monetize. We know many channels create content that follows a similar pattern. What’s important is that the substance of each video should be relatively varied.

Examples of what is allowed to monetize (including but not limited to):

*   Same intro and outro for your videos, but the bulk of your content is different
*   Similar content, where each video talks specifically about the qualities of the subject you’re featuring
*   Short clips of similar objects edited together where you explain how they’re connected

#### Content that violates this guideline

When a channel’s content consists of similar content, it can frustrate viewers who come to YouTube for appealing and interesting videos. That means channels where content is only slightly different from video to video are not allowed to monetize. In other words, your channel shouldn’t have content that's produced using a template and repeated at scale.

Examples of what’s not allowed to monetize (this list is not exhaustive):

*   Content that exclusively features readings of other materials you did not originally create, like text from websites or news feeds
*   Songs modified to change the pitch or speed, but are otherwise identical to the original song
*   Similar repetitive content with low educational value, commentary, narratives, or minimal variation across videos
*   Mass-produced content using a similar template across multiple videos
*   Image slideshows or scrolling text with minimal or no narrative, commentary, or educational value

### Reused content

Reused content refers to channels that repurpose content that’s already on YouTube or another online source without adding significant original commentary, substantive modifications, or educational or entertainment value. Reused content may also be known as duplicative or scraped content (taking unique or original content from other websites and publishing it as your own).

To figure out whether your content is reused, our reviewers will check your channel to understand how you created, participated in, or produced your content. Our reviewers may check your channel’s:

*   Videos
*   Channel description
*   Video title
*   Video descriptions

Our reused content policy applies to your channel as a whole. If you have videos that violate our guidelines, or if we cannot clearly tell that you made the content, monetization may be removed from your entire channel.

#### What is allowed to monetize

We want to reward creators for original and "authentic" content that adds value to viewers. If you put a funny or thoughtful spin on content you didn’t originally create (in line with our guidelines below), you’ve transformed the content in some way. It’s fine to have this type of content on your channel, but individual videos may be subject to other policies like [copyright](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2797466). In other words, we allow reused content if viewers can tell that there’s a meaningful difference between the original video and your video.

**Note:** While these examples do not violate the reused content monetization policy, other policies, such as [copyright](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2797466), still apply.

Examples of what’s allowed to monetize (including but not limited to):

*   Using clips for a critical review
*   A scene from a movie where you’ve rewritten the dialog and changed the voiceover
*   Replays of a sports tournament where you explain the moves a competitor did to succeed
*   Reaction videos where you comment on the original video
*   Edited footage from other creators where you add a storyline and commentary
*   Edits to remixed content on Shorts like adding original content to a song from our library, or adding the original audio or video segment from other videos to your content
*   Content that primarily features the uploading creator in the video
*   Reused content from other online sources where the creator is either visible in the content or explains how the creator added to the content
*   Edited footage with audio and visual effects on top of the video’s reused content that demonstrates substantive editing and shows it’s unique to your channel

#### Content that violates this guideline

Taking someone else’s content, making minimal changes, and calling it your own original work would be a violation of this guideline. If we cannot tell that the content is yours, it may be subject to our reused content policy. This policy applies even if you have permission from the original creator. Reused content is separate from YouTube’s Copyright enforcement, which means it’s not based on copyright, permission, or fair use. This guideline means sometimes, you may not get claims against your content, but your channel may still violate our reused content guidelines.

More examples of what’s not allowed to monetize (this list is not exhaustive):

*   Clips of moments from your favorite show edited together with little or no narrative
*   Short videos you compiled from other social media websites
*   Collections of songs from different artists (even if you have their permission)
*   Content uploaded many times by other creators
*   Promotion of other people’s content (even if you have permission)
*   Content downloaded or copied from another online source without any substantive modifications
*   Content that gets views from mostly non-verbal reactions to your videos without added voice commentary

Quality principles for kids and family content

Our aim is to provide kids and families with a safe and enriching experience on YouTube, while finding new ways to reward creators contributing high-quality content to the platform.

If your channel has ["made for kids” content](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9528076), we’ll use YouTube’s [quality principles for kids and family content](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10774223) to determine the monetization status of that content.

If a channel is found to have a strong focus on low-quality “made for kids” content, it may be [suspended](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1727191#ypp-participation-suspended) from the YouTube Partner Program. If an individual video is found to violate these quality principles, it may see [limited or no ads](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9208564).

When checking to see if your “made for kids” content is of low or high quality, nuances and context are important. Visit our [best practices for kids and family content](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10774223) page for guides and examples.

### Application of quality principles for monetization eligibility

There are several [low-quality principles](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10774223) that may affect the overall quality of a particular video. We will consider each principle as a factor for monetization eligibility on a rolling basis. We currently enforce against the low-quality principles for kids and family content listed below. We may increase the scope to include more quality principles over time.

*   _**Heavily promotional:**_ Content that mainly features products, brands and logos (such as toys or food), or encourages excessive buying like unboxing videos.
*   _**Encouraging negative behaviors or attitudes:**_ Content that encourages dangerous activities, wastefulness, bullying, dishonesty, or a lack of respect for others. For example, this content could include dangerous/unsafe pranks, unhealthy eating habits.
*   _**Deceptively educational:**_ This refers to content that uses titles or thumbnails to trick kids into thinking it's educational, when it's really not. It might promise to teach something, like colors or numbers, but show incorrect or unhelpful information.
*   _**Hard to follow:**_ Videos that are confusing or make no sense, often due to jumbled storylines, unclear audio, or lack of clear storyline (beginning, middle & end). This type of video is often the result of mass production or autogeneration.
*   _**Sensational or misleading:**_ Content that is untrue, exaggerated, or bizarre and may confuse a young audience. It might also include “keyword stuffing”, or the practice of using popular keywords of interest to children in a repetitive, altered, or exaggerated way. The keywords may also be used in a way that does not make sense.
*   _**Strange use of children’s characters:**_ This content takes characters kids know and love (animated or live action) and puts them in inappropriate or potentially risky situations.

Creator responsibility

The success of your channel and the YouTube Partner Program is dependent upon the willingness of advertisers to associate their brands with YouTube content. The earnings of all YouTube creators are negatively impacted when advertisers lose trust.

We don’t allow egregious behavior that has a large negative impact on the community. This policy means you should be respectful of your viewers, your fellow creators, and our advertisers -- both on and off YouTube.

If you violate this policy, we may temporarily turn off your monetization or terminate your accounts. This may apply to all of your existing channels, any new channels you create, and channels that you appear on regularly.

If any of your channels have been demonetized or terminated, you should not create new (or use existing) channels to get around these restrictions, or apply to YPP with related channels during your suspension period. Doing so could lead to termination of all channels.

Learn more about [Creator responsibility](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7650329).

Creator integrity

We expect creators in the YouTube Partner Program to be who they say they are and not misrepresent themselves by manipulating their on-platform activity or engaging in deceptive practices.

This means creators should not [artificially inflate](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/3399767) a channel’s engagement, such as views, subs, likes, watch time, and ad impressions. Similarly, creators should not encourage organic engagement on non-compliant content before deleting or obfuscating that content. Engaging in this type of behavior may result in removal from the YouTube Partner Program or termination of your channels. See our [program policies](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/48182?ctx=checklist) for more info

Creators should also not mislead users or YouTube by participating in financially abusive behaviors, such as using our monetization features for illegal, fraudulent, or deceptive transactions. If you violate this policy, we may remove you from the YouTube Partner Program or terminate your channels.

How we'll inform you of policy changes

YouTube is constantly changing and improving the Service, and adapting to the world around us. We may need to make changes to the terms and conditions or policies that apply to your use of the Service - including the Terms of Service, and the YouTube Partner Program Terms, our policies, and other contractual documents - to reflect changes to our Service or for legal, regulatory, or security reasons.

We’ll let you know in writing when we make changes that might impact you. If you do not agree to the modified terms, you may stop using the relevant feature, or terminate your agreement with us.

To help you stay up to date with our policies, we also maintain a permanent log of updates. [View our changelog here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10008196).

How we enforce YouTube monetization policies

Anyone who earns money on YouTube must follow YouTube's channel monetization policies. If you violate any of our policies, YouTube may take the actions outlined below.

Limited Availability
--------------------

Monetization features may not be available in all locations. In addition, due to the suspension of Google advertising systems in Russia, creators cannot monetize any YouTube channels linked to AdSense for YouTube accounts based in Russia. Creators in Russia cannot complete new YPP sign-ups at this time. Monetization features (such as Channel Memberships, Super Chat, Super Stickers, and Merch) have also been paused for viewers in Russia. Monetization has also been paused for all Russian Federation state-funded media channels.

Withhold, adjust, charge back, or offset earnings or payment

We may withhold or adjust any of your earnings associated with violations of the YouTube channel monetization policies. We may also [charge back](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/12843009#nqrevenues) associated earnings against any AdSense for YouTube balance that has not yet been disbursed or offset such amounts against future earnings payable to you.

For any such violations, we need some time to investigate whether the earnings need to be withheld, adjusted, or offset. This may result in payment delays of up to 90 days or until we’ve resolved any third-party rights disputes.

Examples of violations where we might need to withhold or adjust your earnings include (but aren’t limited to) instances of:

*   [Invalid traffic](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10285842) on your content
*   [Fake engagement](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/3399767)
*   [Content ID claims](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6013276)

If your channel is [terminated](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802168) or [suspended](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1311392#suspension) from the YouTube Partner Program, you are no longer entitled to earn any revenue. YouTube may also withhold earnings and refund advertisers or viewers for purchases where appropriate and possible.

We’ll inform you in writing by email or in product when we have to enforce our policies. We will also let you know what options are available to you.

Limit ad revenue from your videos
---------------------------------

As a member of the YouTube Partner Program, you can make your videos eligible to earn ad revenue if they meet our [advertiser-friendly content guidelines](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6162278). However, if your videos are found to not meet our advertiser-friendly guidelines, or if they violate other policies, such as our [age restriction](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802167) or [copyright guidelines](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2797466), your videos may earn limited or no ad revenue.

Suspend your participation in the YouTube Partner Program

Violation of our YouTube channel monetization policies may result in monetization being suspended or permanently disabled on all or any of your accounts. If it’s determined that your channel is no longer eligible for monetization, your channel may lose access to all monetization tools, features, and Modules associated with the YouTube Partner Program. You may also choose to opt out of specific monetization Modules at any time by contacting Creator Support.

#### Data retention

If your monetization agreement with YouTube is terminated, you still can request your YouTube Analytics data from the time you were in the program by contacting Creator Support.

For more information about suspensions, including troubleshooting tips and details about how to reapply to join the program, see: [Monetization is disabled for my channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1727191)

If you’re in the YouTube Partner Program, you can share revenue from ads. This article aims to help you understand which individual videos or Shorts on your channel are suitable for advertisers. Creators can use this article to understand both the platform’s self-certification questionnaire and specific rules about what may earn ad revenue, may earn limited or no ad revenue and what will earn no ad revenue. Our policies apply to all portions of your content (video, Short, or live stream, thumbnail, title, description, and tags). [Learn more about our best practices](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9348366).

**Note**: All content uploaded to YouTube must comply with both our [Community Guidelines](https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/policies/community-guidelines/) and [our Program Policies](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/48182). If your content violates our Community Guidelines, it may be removed from YouTube. If you see violative content, [you can report it](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027).

**What you'll find in this article**

You'll find examples of content not suitable for ads, and may result in a "[limited or no ads](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9269824)" monetization state.

Here are all the main topics that are not advertiser-friendly:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| *   [Inappropriate language](#Inappropriate_language)<br>*   [Violence](#Violence)<br>*   [Adult content](#Adult)<br>*   [Shocking content](#Shocking_content)<br>*   [Harmful acts and unreliable content](#Harmful_dangerous)<br>*   [Hateful & derogatory content](#Hateful)<br>*   [Recreational drugs and drug-related content](#Recreational_drugs) | *   [Firearms-related content](#Firearms)<br>*   [Controversial issues](#Controversial_issues)<br>*   [Sensitive events](#Sensitive_events)<br>*   [Enabling dishonest behavior](#enabling_dishonest_behavior)<br>*   [Inappropriate content for kids and families](#Inappropriate_kids_content)<br>*   [Incendiary and demeaning](#Incendiary_demeaning)<br>*   [Tobacco-related content](#Tobacco) |

To learn more about key terms used throughout these guidelines, see our [table of definitions](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6162278#definitions_zippy).

Please note that context is very important. Artistic content such as music videos may contain elements such as inappropriate language, references to soft drug use, or non-explicit sexual themes, and still be suitable for advertising.

Opening all of the policy details at once can help if you would like to search this page for specific terms. [Click here](#Inappropriate_language_zippy&Violence_zippy&Adult_zippy&Shocking_content_zippy&Harmful_dangerous_zippy&Hateful_zippy&Recreational_drugs_zippy&Firearms_zippy&Controversial_issues_zippy&Sensitive_events_zippy&enabling_dishonest_behavior_zippy&Inappropriate_kids_content_zippy&Indendiary_demeaning_zippy&Tobacco_zippy) to open all of the guides.

### Inappropriate language

Content that contains profanity or vulgarity at the start or throughout the majority of the video may not be suitable for advertising. Occasional use of profanity (such as in music videos, backing tracks, intro/outro music, or music played in the background) won’t necessarily result in your video being unsuitable for advertising.

Policy Detail

| Ads guidance | Questionnaire options & details |
| --- | --- |
| This content can earn ad revenue | Abbreviated or obscured profanity, or words like “hell” or “damn” in the title, thumbnail, or video. Moderate profanity like “bitch”, “douchebag”, "asshole", and “shit” used frequently in the video. Most profanity used within music or stand-up comedy video content.<br><br>**Definitions:**<br><br>*   “Obscured profanity” refers to things like bleeping or muting the word as well as covering written words with black bars, symbols, or text added in post-production.<br>*   “Abbreviated profanity” refers to an acronym like WTF (“what the f\*ck”) where the original term is abbreviated by using its acronyms. |
| This content may earn limited or no ad revenue | Moderate profanity (like “shit”) in the title or thumbnail.<br><br>**Some examples of content that also fall into this category**:<br><br>*   Focal usage of profanity throughout a video (such as profanity used in most sentences).<br>*   Profanity used in the title or thumbnail of music or stand up comedy content. |
| This content will earn no ad revenue | Stronger profanity (like f\*ck) used in thumbnails or titles. Use of extreme profanity, which includes hateful language or slurs in the video, thumbnail, or title such as "n\*\*\*er" or "fa\*\*ot.”<br><br>For additional information about hateful language or slurs, you may also refer to our [hateful & derogatory content guideline](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6162278#Hateful) within our Help Center.<br><br>**Some examples of content that also fall into this category**:<br><br>*   Any use of hateful language in the video. Please refer to [Hateful & derogatory content](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6162278#Hateful) for more info. |

To learn more about key terms used throughout these guidelines, see our [table of definitions](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6162278#definitions_zippy).

### Violence

Content where the focal point is on blood, violence, or injury, when presented without other context, is not suitable for advertising. If you're showing violent content in a news, educational, artistic, or documentary context, that additional context is important. For example, if a video provides news reporting on a violent event like a terrorist attack in a journalistic context, it may be eligible for monetization. Violence in unedited video gameplay is generally acceptable for advertising, but montages where gratuitous violence is the focal point is not. All games (whether realistic or non-realistic) are in scope of this policy.

Policy Detail

| Ads guidance | Questionnaire options & details |
| --- | --- |
| This content can earn ad revenue | Law enforcement including regular duty in action (such as forcible arrest, crowd control, dispute with officer, forcible entry); unedited gameplay violence occurring after the first 15 seconds; mild violence with minimal blood; dead bodies that are fully obscured, blurred, prepared for burial, or shown in historical events like wars, as part of an educational video.

### Definitions

We’ve put together a table of definitions to help you better understand terms commonly used throughout our advertiser-friendly content guidelines.

Definitions

| Terms | Definitions |
| --- | --- |
| Music | This refers to any video that contains music, such as official music videos, art tracks, backing tracks, intro/outro music, reactions to music videos, music playing during dance tutorials, music added or obtained through YouTube's tools, or music played in the background. This does not apply to poetry and spoken word performances. |
| --- | --- |
| Educational | “Educational” refers to informing or teaching about a subject without deliberately misinforming the audience. Educational content expresses an opinion in a neutral way, such as in a discussion of safe sex practices. The following terms are contextually related:<br><br>*   “Documentary” refers to memorializing and preserving historic events by quoting original documents or describing facts, such as in a history of Ancient Egypt.<br>*   “Scientific” refers to advancing inquiry through scientific experimentation and theory, such as when presenting data on human psychology. |
| --- | --- |
| Artistic | “Artistic” refers to art intended to express human creativity such as painting, drawings, architecture, sculpture, literature, poetry, music, performing, and scripted content. An example would be a video of a poetry recital. |
| --- | --- |
| Dramatized | “Dramatized” refers to scripted content such as movies or fictional settings including animated content. |
| --- | --- |
| Graphic, Graphicness | "Graphic” or “graphicness” refers to inclusions of explicit and realistic portrayals such as the following:<br><br>*   Gore or open wounds resulting from violent acts, like street fights.<br>*   Violent acts against animals, like kicking.<br>*   Visuals of sexual acts, sexual body parts and fluids. |
| --- | --- |
| Realism | “Realism” refers to three levels of severity:<br><br>*   “Low realism”: Highly divergent from reality, such as a talking cat.<br>*   “Moderate realism”: Low divergence from reality, such as exaggerated graphics depicting real-world figures such as humans or animated characters in video games.<br>*   “High realism”: Real-world situations depicting humans as main characters, such as a street fight. |
| --- | --- |
| Explicit, Explicitness | “Explicit” or “explicitness” refer to how present or visible the violative subject is in content. Some examples include:<br><br>*   Video showing or depicting an abortion procedure.<br>*   Audio or sounds of someone getting abused. |
| --- | --- |
| Implicit, Implied | “Implicit” or “implied” refer to a suggestive, indirect presence or visibility of the violative subject. Some examples include:<br><br>*   Video showing or depicting shaking beds with moaning sounds that suggest sexual acts.<br>*   Video showing or depicting vehicles blowing up in order to suggest a moment of death. |
| --- | --- |
| Focus, Focal | “Focus” or “focal” refers to when a segment or full video is about a given topic, and that there is repeated reference and focus on the topic. A passing reference to one of the topics listed as controversial or sensitive is not a reason for No Ads. For example, briefly acknowledging a controversial or sensitive topic (e.g. “In next week’s video we’ll be discussing declining rates of suicide.”) wouldn’t be considered focal, but a segment of a video specifically talking about such a topic would be considered focal. Focus need not be verbal. If there is an image or text that focuses on the sensitive issue, that would be considered focus too. Some examples include:<br><br>*   A video focused on how to perform self-harm.<br>*   Content only focused on using strong profanities without other context or reason. |
| --- | --- |
| Fleeting | “Fleeting” refers to moments that are not the focus of content (not focal), and include passing references to topics listed as controversial or sensitive. For example, briefly acknowledging a controversial or sensitive topic (e.g. “In next week’s video we’ll be discussing declining rates of suicide.”) wouldn’t be considered focal, but rather fleeting. |
| --- | --- |
| Sensational | Refers to a manner intended to arouse curiosity or broad interest, especially through the inclusion of exaggerated, graphic, or sensitive details.<br><br>*   “Sensational eating,” such as eating animal or animal parts that are alive or still visibly moving.<br>*   “Sensational preparation or eating” where preparation or eating becomes theatrical, such as part of “mukbang” or an ASMR performance.<br>*   “Sensational depiction of controversial issues” where sensitive topics, like bullying, become the core theme of entertainment, particularly through negative character interactions. |
