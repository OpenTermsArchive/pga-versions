YouTube Channel Monetisation Policies
=====================================

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/3gqynDEORpTmOvDwv156D69K5bcKgUCq3UcV)

**15 July 2025:** We're making a minor update to our 'repetitious content' policy to better clarify that this includes content that is repetitive or mass-produced. We are also renaming this policy from  'repetitious content' to 'inauthentic content'. This type of content has always been ineligible for monetisation under our existing policies, where creators are rewarded for original and authentic content. There is no change to our reused content policy, which reviews content like commentary, clips, compilations and reaction videos.

**10 March 2025:** We're making improvements to our ad suitability review process. As a result, videos undergoing checks (including private videos) may receive an additional review that may be completed by a human. In some cases, video monetisation decisions may take up to 24 hours. This update is designed to improve the accuracy of monetisation decisions and increase your channel's overall monetisation potential. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/16271309).

**3 March 2022:** Due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, we will be temporarily pausing Google and YouTube ads from serving to users located in Russia. We're also pausing access to all monetisation features (such as channel memberships, Super Chat, Super Stickers and Merch) for viewers in Russia. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10008196).

If you're monetising on YouTube, it's important that your channel follows the YouTube monetisation policies. These include the policies described below, as well as YouTube's [Community Guidelines](https://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines), [Terms of Service](https://www.youtube.com/static?template=terms), [copyright policies](https://www.youtube.com/about/copyright/#support-and-troubleshooting), [Rights Clearance Adjustment policies](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/12496325) and [programme policies](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/48182?ctx=checklist).

These policies apply to anyone either in or looking to apply to the YouTube Partner Programme. The [YouTube Shorts monetisation policies](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/12504220) also apply if you're monetising Shorts on YouTube.

All content monetising with ads must follow our [advertiser-friendly content guidelines](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6162278). To earn revenue from fan-funding features, first-time users must accept the Commerce Product Module (CPM) before turning on the individual features. You must also follow the [Commerce Products monetisation policies](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/13195878) when monetising with fan-funding features.

Here's a quick overview of each major policy. Make sure that you read each policy thoroughly, as these policies are used to check if a channel is suitable for monetisation. Our reviewers regularly check to see whether monetising channels follow these policies. [Learn more about how we enforce our policies](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1311392#enforcement).

Bear in mind that when we use the term **video** on this page, it refers to Shorts, long-form videos and live streaming. These policies apply wherever videos are viewed, including the watch page (pages within YouTube, YouTube Music or YouTube Kids), the YouTube video player (the player that embeds YouTube content on other sites) and the YouTube Shorts player (the player that makes Shorts available).

What we check when we review your channel
-----------------------------------------

If you're [making money on YouTube](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/72857), your content should be original and 'authentic'. This means that we expect your content to:

*   Be your original creation. If you borrow content from someone else, you need to change it significantly to make it your own.
*   Not be mass-produced or repetitive. It should be made for the enjoyment or education of viewers, rather than for the sole purpose of getting views.

Our reviewers will check your channel and content against our policies. Since they can't check every video, our reviewers may focus on your channel's:

*   Main theme
*   Most viewed videos
*   Newest videos
*   Biggest proportion of watch time
*   Video metadata (including titles, thumbnails and descriptions)
*   Channel's 'About' section

The above are just examples of content that our reviewers may assess. Please note that our reviewers can and may check other parts of your channel to see whether it fully meets our policies.

Follow the YouTube Community Guidelines
---------------------------------------

These guidelines help to ensure that YouTube remains a great community for viewers, creators and advertisers. Anyone on YouTube needs to follow our Community Guidelines and any content that you post must follow all our [Community Guidelines](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9288567).

Monetising creators should know that these guidelines apply not only to individual videos but also to your channel overall. Content that violates YouTube's [Community Guidelines](https://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines) is not eligible for monetisation and will be removed from YouTube.

Follow our programme policies

AdSense for YouTube allows YouTube partners to get paid for monetising their videos. Make sure that you follow our [programme policies](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/48182?ctx=checklist) and YouTube's [Terms of Service](https://www.youtube.com/static?template=terms).

### Inauthentic content

Inauthentic content refers to mass-produced or repetitive content. This includes content that looks like it's made with a template with little to no variation across videos, or content that's easily replicable at scale.

This policy applies to your channel as a whole. In other words, if you have many videos that violate our guidelines, monetisation may be removed from your entire channel.

#### What is allowed for monetisation

This policy makes sure that monetised content offers viewers something appealing and interesting to watch. In other words, if the average viewer can clearly tell that content on your channel differs from video to video, it's fine to monetise. We know that many channels create content that follows a similar pattern. What's important is that the substance of each video should be relatively varied.

Examples of what is allowed to monetise (including but not limited to):

*   The same intro and outro for your videos, but the bulk of your content is different
*   Similar content, when each video talks specifically about the qualities of the subject that you're featuring
*   Short clips of similar objects edited together, when you explain how they're connected

#### Content that violates this guideline

When a channel's content consists of similar content, it can frustrate viewers who come to YouTube for appealing and interesting videos. This means that channels on which content is only slightly different from video to video are not allowed to monetise. In other words, your channel shouldn't have content that's produced using a template and repeated at scale.

Examples of what's not allowed to monetise (this list is not exhaustive):

*   Content that exclusively features readings of other materials that you did not originally create, like text from websites or news feeds
*   Songs modified to change the pitch or speed but that are otherwise identical to the original song
*   Similar repetitive content with low educational value, commentary, narratives or minimal variation across videos
*   Mass-produced content using a similar template across multiple videos
*   Image slideshows or scrolling text with minimal or no narrative, commentary or educational value

### Reused content

Reused content refers to channels that repurpose content that's already on YouTube or another online source without adding significant original commentary, substantive modifications or educational or entertainment value. Reused content may also be known as duplicative or scraped content (taking unique or original content from other websites and publishing it as your own).

To find out whether your content is reused, our reviewers will check your channel to understand how you created, participated in or produced your content. Our reviewers may check your channel's:

*   Videos
*   Channel description
*   Video title
*   Video descriptions

Our reused content policy applies to your channel as a whole. If you have videos that violate our guidelines or if we cannot clearly tell that you made the content, monetisation may be removed from your entire channel.

#### What is allowed for monetisation

We want to reward creators for original and 'authentic' content that adds value to viewers. If you put a funny or thoughtful spin on content that you didn't originally create (in line with our guidelines below), you've transformed the content in some way. It's fine to have this type of content on your channel, but individual videos may be subject to other policies like [copyright](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2797466). In other words, we allow reused content if viewers can tell that there's a meaningful difference between the original video and your video.

**Note:** While these examples do not violate the reused content monetisation policy, other policies, such as [copyright](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2797466), still apply.

Examples of what's allowed to monetise (including, but not limited to):

*   Using clips for a critical review
*   A scene from a film in which you've rewritten the dialogue and changed the voiceover
*   Replays of a sports tournament in which you explain the moves that a competitor did to succeed
*   Reaction videos in which you comment on the original video
*   Edited footage from other creators to which you add a storyline and commentary
*   Edits to remixed content on Shorts, like adding original content to a song from our library or adding the original audio or video segment from other videos to your content
*   Content that primarily features the uploading creator in the video
*   Reused content from other online sources in which the creator is either visible in the content or explains how the creator added to the content
*   Edited footage with audio and visual effects on top of the video's reused content that demonstrates substantive editing and shows that it's unique to your channel

#### Content that violates this guideline

Taking someone else's content, making minimal changes and calling it your own original work would be a violation of this guideline. If we cannot tell that the content is yours, it may be subject to our reused content policy. This policy applies even if you have permission from the original creator. Reused content is separate from YouTube's copyright enforcement, which means that it's not based on copyright, permission or fair use. This guideline means that sometimes you may not get claims against your content, but your channel may still violate our reused content guidelines.

More examples of what's not allowed for monetisation (this list is not exhaustive):

*   Clips of moments from your favourite show edited together with little or no narrative
*   Short videos that you compiled from other social media websites
*   Collections of songs from different artists (even if you have their permission)
*   Content uploaded many times by other creators
*   The promotion of other people's content (even if you have permission)
*   Content downloaded or copied from another online source without any substantive modifications
*   Content that gets views from mostly non-verbal reactions to your videos without added voice commentary

Quality principles for child- and family-friendly content

Our aim is to provide children and families with a safe and enriching experience on YouTube, while finding new ways to reward creators contributing high-quality content to the platform.

If your channel has ['Made for Kids' content](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9528076), we'll use YouTube's [quality principles for child- and family-friendly content](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10774223) to determine the monetisation status of that content.

If a channel is found to have a strong focus on low-quality 'Made for Kids' content, it may be [suspended](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1727191#ypp-participation-suspended) from the YouTube Partner Programme. If an individual video is found to violate these quality principles, it may see [limited or no ads](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9208564).

When checking to see if your 'Made for Kids' content is of low or high quality, nuances and context are important. Visit our [best practices for child- and family-friendly content](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10774223) page for guides and examples.

### The application of quality principles for monetisation eligibility

There are several [low-quality principles](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10774223) that may affect the overall quality of a particular video. We will consider each principle as a factor for monetisation eligibility on a rolling basis. We currently enforce against the low-quality principles for child- and family-friendly content listed below. We may increase the scope to include more quality principles over time.

*   _**Heavily promotional:**_ Content that mainly features products, brands and logos (such as toys or food) or encourages excessive buying, like unboxing videos.
*   _**Encouraging negative behaviours or attitudes:**_ Content that encourages dangerous activities, wastefulness, bullying, dishonesty or a lack of respect for others. For example, this content could include dangerous/unsafe pranks or unhealthy eating habits.
*   _**Deceptively educational:**_ This refers to content that uses titles or thumbnails to trick children into thinking it's educational, when it's really not. It might promise to teach something, like colours or numbers, but show incorrect or unhelpful information.
*   _**Hard to follow:**_ Videos that are confusing or make no sense, often due to jumbled storylines, unclear audio or lack of a clear storyline (beginning, middle and end). This type of video is often the result of mass production or auto-generation.
*   _**Sensational or misleading:**_ Content that is untrue, exaggerated or bizarre and that may confuse a young audience. It might also include 'keyword stuffing' or the practice of using popular keywords of interest to children in a repetitive, altered or exaggerated way. The keywords may also be used in a way that does not make sense.
*   _**The strange use of children's characters:**_ This content takes characters that children know and love (animated or live action) and puts them in inappropriate or potentially risky situations.

Creator responsibility

The success of your channel and the YouTube Partner Programme is dependent upon the willingness of advertisers to associate their brands with YouTube content. The earnings of all YouTube creators are negatively impacted when advertisers lose trust.

We don't allow egregious behaviour that has a large negative impact on the community. This policy means that you should be respectful of your viewers, your fellow creators and our advertisers – both on and off YouTube.

If you violate this policy, we may temporarily turn off your monetisation or terminate your accounts. This may apply to all of your existing channels, any new channels that you create and channels that you appear on regularly.

If any of your channels have been demonetised or terminated, you should not create new (or use existing) channels to get around these restrictions or apply to the YPP with related channels during your suspension period. Doing so could lead to the termination of all channels.

Learn more about [creator responsibility](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7650329).

Creator integrity

We expect creators in the YouTube Partner Programme to be who they say they are and not misrepresent themselves by manipulating their on-platform activity or engaging in deceptive practices.

This means that creators should not [artificially inflate](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/3399767) a channel's engagement, such as views, subs, likes, watch time and ad impressions. Similarly, creators should not encourage organic engagement on non-compliant content before deleting or obfuscating that content. Engaging in this type of behaviour may result in removal from the YouTube Partner Programme or the termination of your channels. See our [programme policies](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/48182?ctx=checklist) for more info

Creators should also not mislead users or YouTube by participating in financially abusive behaviours, such as using our monetisation features for illegal, fraudulent or deceptive transactions. If you violate this policy, we may remove you from the YouTube Partner Programme or terminate your channels.

How we'll inform you of policy changes

YouTube is constantly changing and improving its service while adapting to the world around us. We may need to make changes to the Terms and Conditions or policies that apply to your use of the service – including the Terms of Service and the YouTube Partner Programme terms, our policies and other contractual documents – to reflect changes to our service or for legal, regulatory or security reasons.

We'll let you know in writing when we make changes that might impact you. If you do not agree to the modified terms, you may stop using the relevant feature or terminate your agreement with us.

To help you stay up to date with our policies, we also maintain a permanent log of updates. [View our change log](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10008196).

How we enforce YouTube monetisation policies

Anyone who earns money on YouTube must follow the YouTube Channel Monetisation Policies. If you violate any of our policies, YouTube may take any of the actions outlined below.

Limited availability
--------------------

Monetisation features may not be available in all locations. In addition, due to the suspension of Google advertising systems in Russia, creators cannot monetise any YouTube channels linked to AdSense for YouTube accounts based in Russia. Creators in Russia cannot complete new YPP sign-ups at this time. Monetisation features (such as Channel Memberships, Super Chat, Super Stickers and Merch) have also been paused for viewers in Russia. Monetisation has also been paused for all Russian Federation state-funded media channels.

Withhold, adjust, charge back or offset earnings or payment

We may withhold or adjust any of your earnings associated with violations of the YouTube Channel Monetisation Policies. We may also [charge back](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/12843009#nqrevenues) associated earnings against any AdSense for YouTube balance that has not yet been disbursed or offset such amounts against future earnings payable to you.

For any such violations, we need some time to investigate whether the earnings need to be withheld, adjusted or offset. This may result in payment delays of up to 90 days or until we've resolved any third-party rights disputes.

Examples of violations for which we might need to withhold or adjust your earnings include (but are not limited to) instances of:

*   [Invalid traffic](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10285842) on your content
*   [Fake engagement](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/3399767)
*   [Content ID claims](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6013276)

If your channel is [terminated](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802168) or [suspended](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1311392#suspension) from the YouTube Partner Programme, you are no longer entitled to earn any revenue. YouTube may also withhold earnings and refund advertisers or viewers for purchases where appropriate and possible.

We'll inform you in writing by email or in product when we have to enforce our policies. We will also let you know what options are available to you.

Limit ad revenue from your videos
---------------------------------

As a member of the YouTube Partner Programme, you can make your videos eligible to earn ad revenue if they meet our [advertiser-friendly content guidelines](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6162278). However, if your videos are found to not meet our advertiser-friendly guidelines, or if they violate other policies, such as our [age restriction](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802167) or [copyright guidelines](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2797466), your videos may earn limited or no ad revenue.

For more information about reasons why content may not be eligible for monetisation, see the [monetisation icon guide for YouTube Studio](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9208564)

Suspend your participation in the YouTube Partner Programme

Violation of our YouTube Channel Monetisation Policies may result in monetisation being suspended or permanently disabled on all or any of your accounts. If it's determined that your channel is no longer eligible for monetisation, your channel may lose access to all monetisation tools, features and modules associated with the YouTube Partner Programme. You may also choose to opt out of specific monetisation modules at any time by contacting Creator Support.

#### Data retention

If your monetisation agreement with YouTube is terminated, you still can request your YouTube Analytics data from the time that you were in the programme by contacting Creator Support.

For more information about suspensions, including troubleshooting tips and details about how to reapply to join the programme, see [Monetisation is disabled for my channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1727191)

Suspend or even terminate your YouTube channel
----------------------------------------------

In exceptional circumstances, we may need to terminate a channel or account or disable a user's access to the service in order to protect the integrity of the platform or protect our users from harm. Learn more about [channel terminations](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802168?hl=en-GB) and [disabled Google Accounts](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/40695), including what you can do if you believe that your channel or account was terminated by mistake.
