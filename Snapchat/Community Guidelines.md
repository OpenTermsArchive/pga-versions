Community Guidelines

Updated: January 18, 2022

At Snap, we contribute to human progress by empowering people to express themselves, live in the moment, learn about the world, and have fun together. We created these Community Guidelines to support our mission by encouraging the broadest range of self-expression, while making sure Snapchatters can use our services safely every day. We intend for these Guidelines to be clear and understandable for all members of our community. 

These Guidelines apply to all content (which includes all forms of communication, like text, images, links or attachments, emojis and creative tools) on Snapchat — and to all Snapchatters, equally. Advertisers and media partners in Discover agree to additional guidelines, including the requirement that their content is accurate and, where appropriate, fact-checked. In certain cases, we won’t take action against content when it is newsworthy, factual, and relates to a matter of political, social, or other general concern to our community.

We've outlined here and in our [Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/en-US/terms) specific rules for content that is prohibited on Snapchat. But it's hard to anticipate every situation that might come up. The key is the spirit of these rules: we want Snapchat to be a safe and positive experience for everyone. We reserve the right to decide, in our sole discretion, what content violates that spirit and will not be permitted on the platform.

Sexually Explicit Content

* We prohibit accounts that promote or distribute pornographic content.
    
* We report all instances of child sexual exploitation to authorities. Never post, save, or send nude or sexually explicit content involving anyone under the age of 18 — even of yourself. Never ask a minor to send sexually explicit content.
    
* Breastfeeding and other depictions of nudity in certain non-sexual contexts may be permitted.
    

Harassment & Bullying

* We prohibit bullying or harassment of any kind. If someone blocks you, you may not contact them from another account.
    
* Sharing another person’s private information and Snaps of people in private spaces — like a bathroom, bedroom, locker room or a medical facility — without their knowledge and consent is not allowed.
    
* If someone is depicted in your Snap and asks you to remove it, please do! Respect the privacy rights of others.
    

Threats, Violence & Harm

* Encouraging violence or dangerous behavior is prohibited — never intimidate or threaten to harm a person, a group of people, or someone’s property.
    
* Snaps of gratuitous or graphic violence, including animal abuse are not allowed.
    
* We don’t allow the glorification of self-harm, including the promotion of self-injury, suicide or eating disorders
    

Impersonation, Deceptive Practices & False Information

* We prohibit pretending to be someone (or something) that you’re not, or attempting to deceive people about who you are. This includes impersonating your friends, celebrities, brands, or other organizations.
    
* We prohibit spreading false information that causes harm or is malicious, such as denying the existence of tragic events, unsubstantiated medical claims, undermining the integrity of civic processes, or manipulating content for false or misleading purposes.
    
* We disallow spam and deceptive practices, including imitating Snapchat or Snap Inc.
    

Illegal Activity

* Don’t use Snapchat for any illegal activity — including to promote criminal activity; facilitate or participate in cybercrime; or to buy, sell or facilitate sales of illegal or regulated drugs, contraband, weapons, and counterfeit goods or documents.
    
* We prohibit the promotion of regulated goods or industries, including illegal gambling, tobacco products, and alcohol.
    

Terrorism, Hate Groups, and Hate Speech

* Terrorist, extremist and hate groups are prohibited from using our platform. We have no tolerance for content that advocates or advances violent extremism or terrorism.
    
* Hate speech or content that demeans, defames, or promotes discrimination or violence on the basis of race, color, caste, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, or veteran status, immigration status, socio-economic status, age, weight or pregnancy status is prohibited.
    

Please remember that you can always file a report with our Trust & Safety team using our [in-app reporting feature](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/7012399221652) or by completing [this form](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/requests/new?start=5153567363039232). We review these reports to determine violations of these Guidelines. Please visit our [Safety Center](https://www.snap.com/safety/safety-center) for more information about safety at Snapchat. There, you’ll find detailed instructions on managing your Snapchat experience, including taking actions like updating your privacy settings, choosing who can see your content, and blocking other users.

If you violate these Community Guidelines, we may remove the offending content, terminate or limit the visibility of your account, and/or notify law enforcement. We engage with global law enforcement when activity poses a threat to human life.  If your account is terminated for violating our Terms of Service or these Guidelines, you are not allowed to use Snapchat again.   

Snap reserves the right to remove users whom we have reason to believe, in our sole discretion, pose a clear and present danger to others, on or off of Snapchat. These include leaders of hate groups and terrorist organizations, and individuals with a reputation for inciting violence or behavior that we believe poses a threat to human life.

Please take these Guidelines seriously and honor them in the spirit in which they are intended.
