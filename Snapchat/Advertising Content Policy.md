**Snap Advertising Policies**


---------------------------------

1\. Introduction


--------------------

Snapchat is an app that empowers people to express themselves, live in the moment, learn about the world, and have fun together. It's the easiest and fastest way to communicate the full range of human emotions with your friends without pressure to be popular, pretty, or perfect.

In that spirit of authenticity, we expect advertisers to be honest about their products, services, and content, to be kind to our diverse community, and to never compromise Snapchatters’ privacy. 

These Advertising Policies apply to all aspects of advertisements (“ads”) served by Snap––including any creative elements, landing page, or other relevant components of the ads themselves––and you are responsible for ensuring all ads comply.

Advertisers are also required to comply with Snap’s [Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-GB) and [Community Guidelines](https://www.snap.com/community-guidelines?lang=en-GB), and all other Snap policies governing the use of our Services. We may update our terms, policies, and guidelines from time to time, so please check in and review them regularly.

All ads are subject to our review and approval. We reserve the right to reject or remove any ad in our sole discretion for any reason, including in response to user feedback, which we take seriously. We also reserve the right to request modifications to any ad, to require factual substantiation for any claim made in an ad, or to require documents evidencing that you hold any license or authorization which may be required in connection with your ad.

Snap may suspend or terminate accounts tied to businesses or individuals who violate our Advertising Policies.

Snapchatters may share ads with others or save ads to their devices. They may use any of the tools and features we make available in Snapchat to apply captions, drawings, filters, or other creative elements to the ad or, if you run ads in the Audience Network, they may use any tools and features made available where the ad is run. Age-targeted ads can be shared within Snapchat with Snapchatters of any age. To find out if you can restrict ad sharing and ad saving for your ads within Snapchat, please contact your account representative or visit our [Business Help Center.](https://businesshelp.snapchat.com/i-need-help?lang=en-GB&language=en_GB)

We may publish information related to ads (including the creative, targeting, paying entity, contact information, and the price paid for those ads), or share that information with third parties, including: (a) our media partners when your ads run in content related to that media partner; and (b) third parties whose products or services you’ve elected to use in connection with the ads.

As we say in our [Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-GB), if you use a service, feature, or functionality that is operated by a third party and made available through our Services (including Services we jointly offer with the third party), each party’s terms will govern the respective party’s relationship with you. Snap and its affiliates are not responsible or liable for a third party’s terms or actions.

2\. General Requirements


----------------------------

2.1 Targeting and Compliance

All advertisements must be suitable for their selected audience in each geographic area where the advertisements will run. Snapchat is a 13+ app, so we will reject advertisements that are addressed to, or intended to appeal to, children under the age of 13. 

Advertisements must comply with all applicable laws, statutes, ordinances, rules, public order rules, industry codes, regulations and cultural sensitivities in each geographic area where the advertisements will run. Please note:

3.10 Snap Political and Advocacy Advertising Policies

Snapchat empowers self-expression, including about politics. But political advertising that appears on Snapchat has to be transparent, lawful and right for our users.

Requirements

These Political Advertising Policies apply to all political advertisements served by Snap, including election-related advertisements, advocacy advertisements and issue advertisements.

Political advertising must comply with all the applicable laws and regulations, including all national election laws, copyright law, defamation law and (where applicable) Federal Election Commission regulations and state or local laws and regulations. Complying with those laws and regulations will be the sole responsibility of the advertiser.

All political advertising must include a “paid for by” message in the advertisement that is followed by the name of the paying person or entity. Snap may also require a “paid for by” disclosure on advertisement content that links to political content, advertisement content for political merchandise or in other cases at Snap's sole discretion. In the United States, electoral advertisements must state whether the advertisement was authorised by a candidate or organisation; election advertisements not authorised by the candidate must include contact information for the sponsoring organisation.

Like all advertisements on Snapchat, political advertisements must comply with Snap's [Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-GB), [Community Guidelines](https://www.snap.com/community-guidelines?lang=en-GB) and our Advertising Policies. That means, amongst other things:

We encourage political advertisers to be positive. But we don't categorically ban “attack” advertisements; expressing disagreement with or campaigning against a candidate or party is generally permissible if it meets our other guidelines. That said, political advertisements must not include attacks relating to a candidate's personal life.

In Canada, Snap does not permit “partisan advertising” or “election advertising” (as defined by the Canada Elections Act, as amended from time to time (the “Act”)) purchased directly or indirectly on behalf of an eligible party, registered association, nomination contestant, potential or actual candidate or a third party required to register under subsection 349.6(1) or 353(1) of the Act. This may include (without limitation) content that promotes or opposes any of these individuals/groups, or an issue associated with any of those individuals/groups.

In the US, Snap does not currently permit advertisements for state or municipal elections or ballot initiatives in Washington state. 

Snap’s rights

Snap will review political advertisements on a case-by-case basis. To get started, please fill in our [political advertiser form](https://businesshelp.snapchat.com/s/political-ad-review-form?language=en_US&lang=en-GB).

We reserve the right to reject, in our sole discretion, or request modifications to advertisements that we believe violate the standards listed above or that are otherwise inappropriate. Our discretion will never be exercised with the intent to favour or disfavour any candidate, political view or political party.

We also reserve the right to require substantiation of an advertiser’s factual claims.

Snap may publicly display and otherwise disclose information relating to political advertising, including advertisement content, targeting details, delivery, spend and other campaign information.

Political Advertising by Non-Resident Foreign Nationals or Entities

Political advertisements served by Snap may not be paid for directly or indirectly by non-resident foreign nationals or entities – in other words, by people or entities that aren’t residents of the country where the advertisement will run. There is a limited exception to this prohibition for political advertisements targeting any Member State of the European Union (EU), which may be paid for directly or indirectly by entities residing in another EU Member State.

Transparency

We’re proud to maintain transparency with our [political advertisement library](https://www.snap.com/political-ads?lang=en-GB).

4\. Prohibited Content

Ads should not promote harassment, bullying, or shaming. For example: fitness ads should not belittle anyone on the basis of body shape or size. 

We prohibit profanity, obscenity and obscene gestures. 

### 

4.2 Violent or Disturbing

We prohibit the depiction of real-life graphic violence in creatives (e.g., top Snaps, Filters, Sponsored Lenses). Landing pages that depict real-life violent or disturbing imagery may do so only in a legitimate newsworthy or documentary context, only when the top Snap prepares the viewer in some way, and only if appropriately age-targeted. 

For fictional violence in movie trailers, video games, etc., see the Entertainment section. 

We prohibit the glorification of violence, including any glorification of self-harm, war, murder, abuse or animal abuse.

### 

4.4 Hate Speech, Hate Groups, Terrorism and Violent Extremism

The Snapchat community includes diverse users from all over the world. To foster a welcoming platform, we prohibit hateful, discriminatory, or extremist content that undermines our commitment to safety and inclusion. 

Hate speech is content that demeans, defames, or promotes discrimination or violence on the basis of race, color, caste, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, or veteran status, immigration status, socio-economic status, age, weight or pregnancy status.

Avoid perpetuating stereotypes based on any of the categories listed above. 

We strive to maintain an inclusive community for all Snapchatters. Avoid the inappropriate use of culturally-sensitive imagery.

###
