Spotify Partner Program Monetization Policies
=============================================

All shows on Spotify for Creators and Megaphone that apply for the Spotify Partner Program are reviewed against the program’s monetization policies prior to being accepted.

These rules are subject to change at any time as set out in the applicable Spotify Partner Program terms, and anything listed below is illustrative and may not be exhaustive.

### Content policies

We require that creators abide by the [Spotify Platform Rules](https://www.spotify.com/platform-rules/), the [Spotify Monetization Policies](https://adshelp.spotify.com/HelpCenter/s/article/Monetization-Policies-US), the [Spotify Advertising Policies](https://adshelp.spotify.com/HelpCenter/s/article/advertising-policies-US) and the [Spotify Promotional Content Guidelines](https://support.spotify.com/us/creators/article/promotional-content-guidelines/).

In addition, the following types of video content as determined by Spotify are not eligible for Premium Video Revenue through the Spotify Partner Program:

*   Content with audio that consists primarily of non-speech noises or sounds
*   Content with a disproportionate host-read ad or sponsorship load.

Without limiting the actions that Spotify can take under our rules and policies, violations of any of these requirements may result in the content and/or the creator being ineligible or removed from the Spotify Partner Program.

### Policy violations

If you’re applying to the Spotify Partner Program, you’ll be notified via email if your show doesn’t pass our content review.

If we reasonably suspect abuse of our services in any way or see that your content has violated our rules and policies, we reserve the right to remove access to the Spotify Partner Program, withhold accrued earnings, and/or remove your account or content.
