Spotify Partner Program Monetization Policies
=============================================

All shows on Spotify for Creators and Megaphone that apply for the Spotify Partner Program are reviewed against the program’s monetization policies prior to being accepted.

These rules are subject to change at any time and anything listed below is illustrative and may not be exhaustive.

### Content policies

We require that creators abide by the [Spotify Platform Rules](https://www.spotify.com/platform-rules/) and the [Spotify Monetization Policies](https://adshelp.spotify.com/HelpCenter/s/article/Monetization-Policies-US).

In addition, the following types of video content are not eligible for the Spotify Partner Program:

*   Content with audio that consists primarily of non-speech noises or sounds
*   Content that contains third-party-produced promotional content
*   Content with a disproportionate host-read ad or sponsorship load

Violations of any of these requirements may result in content and/or the creator being ineligible or removed from the Spotify Partner Program.

### Policy violations

If you’re applying to the Spotify Partner Program through Spotify for Creators, you’ll be notified via email if your show doesn’t pass our content review.

If we reasonably suspect abuse of our services in any way or see that your content has violated our policies, we reserve the right to remove access to the Spotify Partner Program, withhold accrued earnings, and/or remove your account or content.
