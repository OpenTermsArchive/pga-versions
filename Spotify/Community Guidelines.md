Spotify Platform Rules
======================

Spotify’s mission is to unlock the potential of human creativity – by giving a million creative artists the opportunity to live off their art, and billions of fans the opportunity to enjoy and be inspired by it. We believe that achieving this mission on our platform is made possible by welcoming different forms of artistic expression, ideas, perspectives and voices. This may mean that some content on our platform may not be to each individual’s liking or is content that Spotify endorses.

However, that doesn’t mean that anything goes on our platform. In addition to the terms that you agreed to governing your use of our services, these rules help ensure that everyone has a safe and enjoyable experience.

What are the rules?
-------------------

Whether you are a musician, podcaster or other contributor, it is important to be aware of what is not allowed on our platform. The examples in the below sections are for illustrative purposes and are not exhaustive.

### Dangerous content

Spotify is home to communities where people can create, express themselves, listen, share, learn and be inspired. Don’t promote violence, incite hatred, harass, bully or engage in any other behaviour that may place people at risk of serious physical harm or death. **What to avoid:**

**Content that advocates or glorifies serious physical harm towards an individual or group** includes, but may not be limited to:

* Encouraging the consumption of bleach products to cure various illnesses and diseases
* Promoting or suggesting that vaccines approved by local health authorities are designed to cause death

### Deceptive content

Creating great experiences on Spotify requires trust that people are who they say they are, that they won’t be scammed and that no one is trying to manipulate our platform. Don’t use malicious practices to deceive others. **What to avoid:**

**Content that impersonates others in order to deceive** includes, but may not be limited to:

* Replicating the same name, image and/or description as another existing creator
* Posing as another person, brand or organisation in a misleading manner

**Content that promotes manipulated and synthetic media as authentic in ways that pose the risk of harm** includes, but may not be limited to:

* Audio or video recording that comes from a real and valid source that has been altered in a way that changes the meaning or context of the original media and is purported to be true, thus posing a risk of harm to the speaker or other individuals
* Audio or visual media artificially created through the use of technology that’s purported to be true, such as digitally manufactured sexual audio and video content or content falsely suggesting that someone committed a crime

**Content that attempts to manipulate or interfere with election-related processes** includes, but may not be limited to:

* Misrepresentation of procedures in a civic process that could discourage or prevent participation
* Misleading content promoted to intimidate or suppress voters from participating in an election

How does Spotify enforce these rules?
-------------------------------------

Spotify seeks to enforce these rules consistently and at scale across the world using a combination of technology and human review. In addition to user reports, we leverage automated tools that rely on a combination of signals to detect content that may violate our Platform Rules.

We have global teams of experts who develop, maintain and enforce our Platform Rules. When potentially violating content is reported or detected, our teams will work to take the appropriate enforcement action.

What happens when the rules are broken?
---------------------------------------

We take these decisions seriously and keep context in mind when assessing possible Platform Rules violations. Breaking the rules may result in the violative content being removed from Spotify. Repeated or egregious violations may result in accounts being suspended and/or terminated. Learn more about other actions that we may take on content or accounts [here](https://www.spotify.com/safetyandprivacy/content-actions/).

What else do I need to know?
----------------------------

These Platform Rules will help ensure that Spotify remains an open and safe platform for all. We will continue to evaluate and update this information as needed, so please check back frequently. Depending on which Spotify products or features you use, you may be subject to additional requirements.
