Spotify Platform Rules
======================

Spotify’s mission is to unlock the potential of human creativity – by giving a million creative artists the opportunity to live off their art, and billions of fans the opportunity to enjoy and be inspired by it. We believe that achieving this mission on our platform is made possible by welcoming different forms of artistic expression, ideas, perspectives and voices. This may mean that some content on our platform may not be to each individual’s liking or is content that Spotify endorses.

However, that doesn’t mean that anything goes on our platform. In addition to the terms that you agreed to governing your use of our services, these rules help ensure that everyone has a safe and enjoyable experience.

What are the rules?

How does Spotify enforce these rules?
-------------------------------------

Spotify seeks to enforce these rules consistently and at scale across the world using a combination of technology and human review. In addition to user reports, we leverage automated tools that rely on a combination of signals to detect content that may violate our Platform Rules.

We have global teams of experts who develop, maintain and enforce our Platform Rules. When potentially violating content is reported or detected, our teams will work to take the appropriate enforcement action.

What happens when the rules are broken?
---------------------------------------

We take these decisions seriously and keep context in mind when assessing possible Platform Rules violations. Breaking the rules may result in the violative content being removed from Spotify. Repeated or egregious violations may result in accounts being suspended and/or terminated. Learn more about other actions that we may take on content or accounts [here](https://www.spotify.com/safetyandprivacy/content-actions/).

What else do I need to know?
----------------------------

These Platform Rules will help ensure that Spotify remains an open and safe platform for all. We will continue to evaluate and update this information as needed, so please check back frequently. Depending on which Spotify products or features you use, you may be subject to additional requirements.
