Spotify Platform Rules
======================

Spotify’s mission is to unlock the potential of human creativity – by giving a million creative artists the opportunity to live off their art, and billions of fans the opportunity to enjoy and be inspired by it. We believe that achieving this mission on our platform is made possible by welcoming different forms of artistic expression, ideas, perspectives and voices. This may mean that some content on our platform may not be to each individual’s liking or is content that Spotify endorses.

However, that doesn’t mean that anything goes on our platform. In addition to the terms that you agreed to governing your use of our services, these rules help ensure that everyone has a safe and enjoyable experience.

What are the rules?
-------------------

Whether you are a musician, podcaster or other contributor, it is important to be aware of what is not allowed on our platform. The examples in the below sections are for illustrative purposes and are not exhaustive.

### Deceptive content

Creating great experiences on Spotify requires trust that people are who they say they are, that they won’t be scammed and that no one is trying to manipulate our platform. Don’t use malicious practices to deceive others. **What to avoid:**

**Content that impersonates others in order to deceive** includes, but may not be limited to:

How does Spotify enforce these rules?

Spotify seeks to enforce these rules consistently and at scale across the world using a combination of technology and human review. In addition to user reports, we leverage automated tools that rely on a combination of signals to detect content that may violate our Platform Rules.

We have global teams of experts who develop, maintain and enforce our Platform Rules. When potentially violating content is reported or detected, our teams will work to take the appropriate enforcement action.

What happens when the rules are broken?
---------------------------------------

We take these decisions seriously and keep context in mind when assessing possible Platform Rules violations. Breaking the rules may result in the violative content being removed from Spotify. Repeated or egregious violations may result in accounts being suspended and/or terminated. Learn more about other actions that we may take on content or accounts [here](https://www.spotify.com/safetyandprivacy/content-actions/).

What else do I need to know?
----------------------------

These Platform Rules will help ensure that Spotify remains an open and safe platform for all. We will continue to evaluate and update this information as needed, so please check back frequently. Depending on which Spotify products or features you use, you may be subject to additional requirements.

How can I report an issue?
--------------------------

Have you found an issue with a piece of content on Spotify? If so, please let us know by reporting it [here](https://support.spotify.com/content-policy-reporting/).

Content actions
===============

What actions can be taken on content?
-------------------------------------

There are a variety of actions that Spotify may take on content that violates the [Platform Rules](https://www.spotify.com/safetyandprivacy/platform-rules/), applicable laws or that may contain sensitive topics. These actions include removing content, restricting content’s discoverability, restricting the ability of content to be monetised and/or applying content advisory labels.

We consider a variety of factors when determining what action(s) to take, such as the context behind a particular topic or current event and the severity and/or frequency of violations observed as part of our review process. We leverage a variety of algorithmic and human detection measures to help identify content that may need to be actioned, including user reports. Any abuse of our processes, including targeted reporting of the same content or user, may restrict your ability to submit requests in the future.

Removing content
----------------

If content violates our [Platform Rules](https://www.spotify.com/safetyandprivacy/platform-rules/), it may be removed from Spotify.

Removing an account
-------------------

Repeated and/or egregious violations of the [Platform Rules](https://www.spotify.com/safetyandprivacy/platform-rules/) may result in an account being suspended and/or terminated. Note that this may also include all related and affiliated Spotify accounts.

Restricting the discoverability of content
------------------------------------------

In instances when content comes close to the line but does not meet the threshold of removal under our [Platform Rules](https://www.spotify.com/safetyandprivacy/platform-rules/), we may take steps to restrict its reach. Though the content will remain available on Spotify, it may be:

*   Ineligible for on-platform promotion;
*   Reduced within recommendations;
*   Ranked lower in search results; and/or
*   Excluded from some Spotify product features.

During periods of heightened risk, there is often a greater threat of harmful content online, for example, during elections, violent conflict or mass-casualty events. Recognising this, Spotify may take additional steps during such events, like restricting the reach of certain types of content and/or highlighting timely and trusted resources.

Restricting content monetisation by Spotify
-------------------------------------------

Not all content is eligible for monetisation on Spotify. In addition to the [Platform Rules](https://www.spotify.com/safetyandprivacy/platform-rules/), content that you wish to monetise will be reviewed against our [monetisation policies](https://adshelp.spotify.com/HelpCenter/s/article/Monetization-Policies).

Including a content advisory
----------------------------

In situations when more context may be needed on a given topic, a content advisory label may be applied with relevant information and/or to link users to timely, trusted resources.

Restricting content in a specific country or region
---------------------------------------------------

Spotify is a global community and respects the laws of the countries in which we operate. Users must comply with applicable laws and regulations. Content that does not violate our Platform Rules may still be restricted in specific countries or regions where the content has been found to violate local law(s).

Appeals
-------

Options for appealing content decisions vary by location, and we will continue to expand our capabilities in the future.

If you disagree with an enforcement decision taken on your content or in response to your report, you may be able to submit an appeal. To do this, please follow the instructions in the notification that you may have received from Spotify.

Reporting content on Spotify
============================

Overview
--------

At Spotify, we work hard to elevate creative expression and want our community to safely present their authentic selves, but that does not mean that anything goes.

Our long-standing [Platform Rules](https://www.spotify.com/safetyandprivacy/platform-rules/) outline what is and isn’t allowed on Spotify. We prioritise the review of content that impacts minors, presents a greater risk of offline harm or may be illegal.

What type of actions are taken against illegal content or content that violates the Platform Rules?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When we find content that violates our [Platform Rules](https://www.spotify.com/safetyandprivacy/platform-rules/) or is illegal under local law, we may take a [range of actions](https://www.spotify.com/safetyandprivacy/content-actions/). These actions may include removing content, restricting distribution, applying content advisory labels and/or demonetisation.

How can someone report content on Spotify?
------------------------------------------

If you feel that a piece of content may violate our [Platform Rules](https://www.spotify.com/safetyandprivacy/platform-rules/), please report it through our secure reporting [form](https://support.spotify.com/content-policy-reporting/). The content owner will not know who made the report.

To report content that you believe infringes your intellectual property rights or otherwise violates the law, please [contact us](https://support.spotify.com/report-content/). Content reported through this form (unless it is being reported for intellectual property reasons) will also be reviewed for Platform Rules violations. More information on Spotify's policy to address intellectual property infringement can be found in our [Copyright Policy](https://www.spotify.com/legal/copyright-policy/).

Abuse of our reporting process can lead to restrictions on your ability to submit reports in the future, and repeated violations of the [Spotify Terms of Use](https://www.spotify.com/legal/end-user-agreement/), including our [Platform Rules](https://www.spotify.com/safetyandprivacy/platform-rules/), may result in your account being suspended or terminated.

Authorities listed in the Official Journal of the European Union can report content for the purposes of the [Regulation (EU) 2021/784 on addressing the dissemination of terrorist content online](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX%3A32021R0784) by [emailing us](mailto:<eu-terreg@spotify.com>). We will not respond to requests sent by anyone other than relevant authorities.

Who can report content?
-----------------------

Anyone with an email address can report content on Spotify, even if they do not have a Spotify account. Please note that abuse of our reporting process may restrict your ability to submit requests in the future.

Can content decisions be appealed?
----------------------------------

Options for appealing content decisions vary by location, and we will continue to expand our capabilities in the future.

If you disagree with an enforcement decision taken on your content or in response to your report, you may be able to submit an appeal. To do this, please follow the instructions in the notification that you may have received from Spotify.

How do I report other problems with the app?
--------------------------------------------

If you find inaccurate information or issues with app functionality, you can [report them here](https://support.spotify.com/article/faulty-inaccurate-metadata/). If you’re an artist, your label or distributor can help fix problems with your music.

Guidance for parents or caregivers
==================================

Platforms like Spotify provide a unique opportunity for parents and children to explore together, find educational content and listen to music. Some of you have benefited from lullaby playlists to get your children off to sleep, and many others have enjoyed introducing them to that particular song that you loved when you were their age. In recent years, there has been a lot of growth in the amount of online spaces that children can use, and it can be overwhelming to know how best to keep them safe while they play.

I’m Alex Holmes, and I sit on the global safety advisory boards of a number of the major social media companies, advising them on their approach to safety and online harms, including [Spotify](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2022-06-13/introducing-the-spotify-safety-advisory-council/). I am also Deputy CEO of the non-profit [The Diana Award](https://diana-award.org.uk/), a legacy of Princess Diana’s belief that young people have the power to change the world. I founded the peer-to-peer support programme [Anti-Bullying Ambassadors](https://www.antibullyingpro.com/) when I was 16 after being bullied myself. As you can imagine, I am keenly interested in addressing any barriers to children’s happiness and well-being.

In the online world, I always suggest that parents should work together with their children to keep them safe. Discuss what types of content you are comfortable with them listening to, and help them understand what they can do if content makes them feel upset or worried. As a part of their commitment to keeping children safe, Spotify has put together a guide below that outlines the latest tools and features they have designed for children, including parental control that you can use to protect them from explicit content and ways for you to [report](https://support.spotify.com/content-policy-reporting/) any unwanted content or attention.

It is hard to navigate all the different platforms that your child might use, and I encourage every parent or carer to work with their child to understand Spotify, the kinds of music that they are listening to and the ways in which they are engaging with others. It may also be useful to help them think about their actions towards other children and that they should be considerate of playlist titles, profiles or playlist photos/uploads. Encourage them to share their playlists with you, as this could be an opportunity to curate and connect together, and have a healthy dialogue.

Music and audio are important parts of how children learn to express themselves and understand the world. With the right support, you can use tools like Spotify to help them become more confident, resilient and curious, while balancing their privacy, freedom and your own parenting style. Ultimately, talking with your child about these matters is the best way to show them that you are there to support them as they learn about the digital world.

Creating a safe experience for young people
-------------------------------------------

Spotify is a digital music, podcast and audiobook service that provides access to millions of songs and other content from creators all over the world. We understand that navigating the digital world can be challenging for parents and that decisions around the content and experiences that are right for your family are often personal. To help craft an experience that is safe and enjoyable, we have developed an array of important measures. They include:

*   Establishing a zero-tolerance policy against content that exploits children and [Platform Rules](https://www.spotify.com/safetyandprivacy/platform-rules/) ban illegal and/or abusive behaviours that harm children
*   Leveraging [machine-learning signals](https://www.spotify.com/safetyandprivacy/understanding-recommendations) and establishing [user-reporting mechanisms](https://support.spotify.com/content-policy-reporting/) to detect to potential policy and/or legal violations
*   Staffing teams to review and promptly action violative content around the clock
*   Connecting potentially vulnerable users’ to [mental health resources](https://resources.byspotify.com/) when they search for content related to suicide, self-harm and disordered eating content
*   Providing parental controls so that Family plan managers can design the most appropriate experience for their family
*   Proactively seeking feedback from experts on our [Spotify Safety Advisory Council](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-05-05/thorn-joins-the-spotify-safety-advisory-council/), such as [Thorn](https://www.thorn.org/) and the [Diana Award](https://diana-award.org.uk/), and partners at the [Jed Foundation](https://jedfoundation.org/resource/understanding-eating-disorders/), [Tech Coalition](https://www.technologycoalition.org/) and [WeProtect Alliance](https://www.weprotect.org/) to ensure that our teams stay up to date with emerging threats and mitigation techniques.

As the child safety landscape evolves, we will continue refining our policies, tools and capabilities. In the meantime, please read on to learn more about the steps that you can take as a parent or guardian to help us create a safe experience.

Your child’s experience on Spotify
----------------------------------

### Creating an account

All users must meet the [minimum age requirement](https://www.spotify.com/legal/end-user-agreement/) for the country associated with their account. If your child is under the minimum age to use Spotify or does not otherwise meet the requirements of our [Terms of Use](https://www.spotify.com/de-en/safetyandprivacy/$\(terms_use_url\)), their account must be closed.

When creating an account, it’s important to represent your child’s age accurately. This helps to ensure compliance with local laws and helps us deliver an age-appropriate product experience.

### Premium Family plans

In certain markets, we currently offer the following experiences as part of our [Premium Family plan](https://www.spotify.com/family/):

*   **Spotify Kids** is a standalone app that offers a curated experience and includes content that may resonate more with younger children. To learn more, click [here](https://www.spotify.com/kids/).

Whether you opt in to a Premium Family plan or not, Spotify provides various tools to help you curate the experience that’s right for your family.

### Designing a safe experience for your child

Decisions about what types of content are most suitable for your family can be deeply personal. To help tailor your family’s experience, you may consider skipping explicit content or controlling the playback of specific artists.

#### Explicit content filter

Creators and rights holders often mark content that may contain adult language or themes as “Explicit content” or add an “E” tag. To skip content that’s been tagged as explicit, you can follow the instructions [here](https://support.spotify.com/article/explicit-content/).

_Pro tip:_ If you’re playing music from a shared device or in the presence of a child (for example, a family road trip or birthday party), turning on your explicit content filter can help avoid unintentional awkward moments.

_Pro tip:_ It is sometimes possible to find clean versions of content tagged as explicit on Spotify.

To report a song, podcast or audiobook that isn’t tagged correctly, contact us [here](https://support.spotify.com/article/contact-us/).

#### Controlling the playback for specific artists

You can control the playback of specific artists on your mobile device or the mobile device of other members of your Family plan by going to the artist profile, clicking the three dots and selecting “Don’t play this” within each account.

#### Marking content as “not interested”

Mobile users can also use the [“not interested”](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Implemented-Ideas/Discover-Please-add-a-quot-Not-Interested-quot-Button/idi-p/5275001) button to control their experiences better. Content that you mark as “not interested” will instantly be removed from your subfeed and won’t show up again. Any other songs/albums/episodes by that artist/podcast show will also be filtered out from future recommendations.

#### Reporting violative content

All content on Spotify must comply with local laws and our [Platform Rules](https://www.spotify.com/safetyandprivacy/platform-rules/). These Rules were developed by our in-house team of safety policy experts with feedback from trusted global safety experts, including our [Spotify Safety Advisory Council](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2022-06-13/introducing-the-spotify-safety-advisory-council/). We also have teams staffed globally around the clock to help ensure that content is promptly reviewed and [actioned](https://www.spotify.com/safetyandprivacy/content-actions/) appropriately.

Our policies and enforcement approach are not static and evolve in response to changing abuse trends, the global regulatory landscape, new content types and feedback from our trusted safety partners.

If you encounter content that you believe may violate our [Platform Rules](https://www.spotify.com/safetyandprivacy/platform-rules/), please report it through [this form](https://support.spotify.com/content-policy-reporting/). To learn more about additional reporting options, visit our [Safety and Privacy Centre](https://www.spotify.com/safetyandprivacy/).

#### Privacy on Spotify

We’re committed to protecting our users’ personal data, including that of children, and have put mechanisms in place to help ensure that users’ information is safe. Some ways in which we might use personal data are to provide recommendations in your language, suggest a podcast that we think you might enjoy or help you discover your new favourite artist.

To learn more about how we use your data, your privacy rights and choices, and how to adjust your settings, please see our [Safety and Privacy Centre](https://www.spotify.com/safetyandprivacy/learn-more-about-privacy) and read our [Privacy Policy](https://www.spotify.com/legal/privacy-policy/).

Our approach to assuring the age of users
=========================================

Spotify offers personalised listening to music, podcasts and audiobooks for users around the world. But we know not all content or features are suitable for all audiences. To help enable age-appropriate experiences, we’re continuing to better understand our users’ ages.

We are committed to providing age-appropriate experiences, and we have a long history of building with safety by design, thanks to partnerships with industry experts like Thorn, the Tech Coalition, WeProtect Alliance and the Internet Watch Foundation.

We are now expanding testing of improved age-assurance technologies to selected markets, utilising our own internal age-estimation technology and partnering with Yoti, a trusted digital identity company. This technology will help us identify if users are of eligible age to access some Spotify content and features.

Some users will now have to confirm their age by going through an age-assurance process. For example, when a user attempts to watch a music video that has been labelled 18+ by the rights holder for that video, Spotify may serve a prompt for that user to confirm the user’s age. To do so, these users can use facial age-estimation technology or ID document verification through Yoti’s technology integrated into the Spotify app, built with privacy and security in mind.

After the age assurance process is complete, Yoti will delete all the user’s data. Spotify will use the results of the process to improve our ability to provide an age-appropriate experience to all of our users. If a user chooses not to complete the age assurance check, they will not have access to the feature. If a user is confirmed as being underage for a particular feature, they will also not have access to the feature. If a user does not meet the minimum age requirements for accessing Spotify in their market, the account will be deactivated and eventually deleted.

Understanding age online has been a decades-long challenge for technology companies – we’re proud to partner with Yoti, as their innovations lead the industry and help companies like ours make progress against the challenge.

“We’re proud to be working with Spotify to help create safer, age-appropriate experiences,” said Robin Tombs, CEO at Yoti. “Spotify fans can access and enjoy a broad array of features and content, whilst young people will be better protected from the risk of accessing inappropriate experiences. We’re excited to be working closely with the Spotify team on this innovative partnership – enhancing trust and safety for users around the world.”

Our work and technology will continue to improve and optimise as we scale. To learn more about Yoti’s approach, visit their website [here](https://www.yoti.com/business/age-verification/).

Election integrity at Spotify
=============================

Spotify is the place to find your new favourite creator, discover a new song from your favourite artist or unlock an audiobook that brings you into a whole new world. While the vast majority of content on our platform is licensed, we are realistic and vigilant about the types of content that can proliferate during sensitive events like elections. We are a home for creative expression and will always offer a wide range of content, but that does not mean that anything goes.

Safeguarding our platform during critical global events is a top priority for our teams, and we’ve spent years developing and refining our approach. Elections are a particularly sensitive time, both on and offline, and our primary focus is always to reduce risk, allowing our listeners, creators and advertisers to enjoy our products.

To understand the types of harm that may occur during a country’s election, we consider a variety of indicators, including Spotify’s presence in the market, historical precedents for harm during voting periods and emerging geo-political factors that may increase on-platform risks. We also look at factors that are especially relevant to the Spotify platform, for example, particular countries where audio content might present concerns.

We monitor these factors on an ongoing basis and use our learnings to inform policy and enforcement guidelines, customise in-product interventions and determine where we may benefit from additional resourcing and/or third-party inputs. Ultimately, our primary focus is always to reduce risk, allowing our listeners, creators and advertisers to enjoy our products.

Platform Rules
--------------

While political or news-related discourse is welcome on Spotify, we have [Platform Rules](https://www.spotify.com/safetyandprivacy/platform-rules/) in place to help set the parameters for what type of content is and is not permitted. These rules apply to everyone on the Spotify platform, and when they are violated, we will always take [action](https://www.spotify.com/safetyandprivacy/content-actions/).

Our Platform Rules clearly state that content that attempts to manipulate or interfere with election-related processes is prohibited. This includes, but may not be limited to, misrepresenting procedures in a civic process that could discourage or prevent participation and misleading content aimed at intimidating or suppressing voters from participating in an election.

Expert partnerships
-------------------

Elections worldwide vary in risk and scope and the types of harmful trends that manifest during these kinds of heightened events are often nuanced and hyper-localised. To augment our global expertise and detection capabilities, Spotify acquired [Kinzen](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2022-10-05/spotify-continues-to-ramp-up-platform-safety-efforts-with-acquisition-of-kinzen/) in 2022. This has allowed us to carry out extensive, ongoing research in multiple languages and key policy areas like misinformation and hate speech. Our research is supported by a pioneering tool called “Spotlight”, specifically designed to identify potential risks quickly within long-form audio content like podcasts.

Additionally, we partner closely with experts on specific types of harm that are commonly found during elections, like misinformation, hate speech and violent extremism. These include our global [Spotify Safety Advisory Council](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2022-06-13/introducing-the-spotify-safety-advisory-council/) and the [Institute for Strategic Dialogue](https://www.isdglobal.org/) to ensure that we stay on top of emerging trends and risk mitigation tactics.

In-product resources
--------------------

We also encourage non-partisan civic and community engagement during key elections. This work is focused on connecting listeners with reliable, local information during the election period. We leverage a combination of algorithmic and human curation to identify content which violates our guidelines, and may update our recommendations to curb potentially manipulated or dangerous information.

In some cases, we also share trusted information on voting as part of non-partisan civic engagement campaigns that we run on-platform, encouraging our users to make their voices heard, whatever their political affiliation. During these campaigns, our global and in-market teams collaborate to create timely, topical and local content that’s focused on overcoming barriers to voting by, for example, explaining how to register and where to cast your vote.

Since we started our efforts, these campaigns have driven [millions of visits](https://www.lifeatspotify.com/reports/Spotify-Equity-Impact-Report-2023.pdf) to resources on civic engagement, helping users check their voter status, register to vote or learn more about their local elections.

Political ads
-------------

Spotify currently accepts political advertisements in certain third-party podcasts via the Spotify Audience Network in a limited number of markets, including the United States and India.

Political ads may be placed in Spotify Audience Network and Spotify’s free, ad-supported service inventory. An account must be eligible for political ads, and the account holder must complete an advertiser identity verification process. Political ads are unavailable for purchase via our self-serve tool, Spotify Ad Studio.

Additionally, we require that political advertisements clearly disclose the use of any synthetic or manipulated media, including media created or edited with the use of artificial intelligence tools, that depicts real or realistic-looking people or events. This disclosure must be included in the advertisement and must be clear and conspicuous.

To read more about political ads in the markets where they are offered, and learn about how to report an ad that you believe violates our policies, please review Spotify’s political advertising [editorial policies](https://adshelp.spotify.com/HelpCenter/s/topic/0TO7S000000Gt54WAC/advertising-policies).

Our approach to dangerous and deceptive content
===============================================

Spotify teams work around the clock to create a safe and enjoyable experience for our creators, listeners and advertisers. While the majority of content on our platform is policy-compliant and most listening time is spent on licensed content, bad actors do occasionally try to spoil the experience by sharing deceptive and/or manipulated information. When we identify content which violates our [Platform Rules](https://www.spotify.com/safetyandprivacy/platform-rules/), we move promptly to take the appropriate [action](https://www.spotify.com/safetyandprivacy/content-actions/). Read on to learn more about the tactics that we use to keep Spotify free from harm.

Deceptive content can take many forms, ranging from innocuous rumours to very serious, targeted campaigns that are designed to spread fear and harm amongst communities. In a changing world, these trends evolve quickly and we leverage the expertise of our internal teams and external partners to better understand these types of manipulation.

In many cases, these sorts of malicious narratives may be shared by someone who might not know that they are false or misleading. And while some falsehoods are not dangerous (“my dog is the smartest in the world”), other egregious examples clearly are (“cancer is a hoax”). The term “misinformation” is frequently used to describe multiple types of manipulated information, including disinformation, which is content deliberately shared by malicious actors to sow doubt on authentic content.

Dangerous and deceptive content is nuanced and complex and requires a great deal of thoughtful evaluation. We believe that addressing these types of violations through multiple policy categories allows us to be more effective and precise in our decisions.

For example, within our [dangerous content policies](https://www.spotify.com/safetyandprivacy/platform-rules/), we make it clear that we do not allow content promoting false or deceptive medical information that may cause offline harm or directly threaten public health. Another example is within our deceptive content policies, which outline that we take action on content that attempts to manipulate or interfere with election-related processes, including that which intimidates or suppresses voters from participating in an election.

When assessing these forms of online abuse, we take multiple factors into account, including:

*   The substance of the content (for example, is the creator pretending to be someone else?)
*   The context (for example, is it a news report about a dangerous narrative that is spreading, or is it endorsing the narrative itself?)
*   The motivation (for example, is the creator attempting to trick a user into voting past the deadline?)
*   The risk of harm (for example, is there a high likelihood that the spread of the narrative will result in imminent physical harm?)

Dangerous deception is often hyper-localised, targeting specific markets, languages and particular at-risk populations. To address this, we leverage [local market expertise](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2022-10-05/spotify-continues-to-ramp-up-platform-safety-efforts-with-acquisition-of-kinzen/) to help ensure that we stay close to emerging trends that may present a serious risk of harm and scale this human knowledge using machine-learning classifiers. This approach is known as “the human in the loop”.

We recognise that this type of content can be more prevalent during periods of uncertainty and volatility, when authoritative information may be scarce. For this reason, we may also take a number of [content actions](https://www.spotify.com/safetyandprivacy/content-actions/) to help limit the spread of potentially abusive content during sensitive events when there is a more pronounced risk of harmful narratives leading to offline violence.

For example, we may restrict the content’s discoverability in recommendations, include a content advisory warning or elect to remove it from the platform. We may also surface content from authoritative sources to ensure that our users have access to accurate and trusted information, such as links to official voting-related resources developed and maintained by election commissions.

We continuously iterate our policies and reviewer guidance based on inputs from within our own Spotify teams, external stakeholders and our partners on the [Spotify Safety Advisory Council](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2022-06-13/introducing-the-spotify-safety-advisory-council/).

Our approach to violent extremism
=================================

Spotify seeks to give artists an opportunity to live off their art, and billions of fans the opportunity to enjoy and be inspired by it. In support of that endeavour, our global teams work around the clock to ensure that the experience along the way is safe and enjoyable for creators, listeners and advertisers.

On Spotify, the vast majority of listening time is spent on licensed content. Regardless of who created the content, our top priority is to allow our community to connect directly with the music, podcasts and audiobooks they love. However, this does not mean that anything goes.

Spotify strictly prohibits content that promotes terrorism or violent extremism and takes action on content that violates our [Platform Rules](https://www.spotify.com/safetyandprivacy/platform-rules/) or the law.

When it comes to violent extremism, we carefully review entities’ on-platform and offline behaviour, including (but not limited to) violent conduct and incitement of violence. We work closely with third parties with [extremism expertise](https://www.isdglobal.org/isd-in-the-news/isd-joins-spotify-safety-advisory-council/) to ensure that we are making the most informed decisions throughout these processes and taking local, regional and cultural context into account.

We address potential violent extremist content through multiple policies, which include, but are not limited to:

*   Our [hate policies](https://www.spotify.com/safetyandprivacy/platform-rules/) prohibit content that explicitly incites violence or hatred toward people based on protected characteristics, including race, sex, ethnicity or sexual orientation.
*   Our [dangerous content policies](https://www.spotify.com/safetyandprivacy/platform-rules/) clearly outline that material which promotes or supports terrorism or violent extremism is strictly not allowed on the Spotify platform.

We identify potentially violative content for review using proactive monitoring methods, [leveraging human expertise](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2022-10-05/spotify-continues-to-ramp-up-platform-safety-efforts-with-acquisition-of-kinzen/) and user reports. We also use insights from global third-party [experts](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2022-06-13/introducing-the-spotify-safety-advisory-council/) to monitor emerging abuse trends and ensure that we’re constantly improving our approach.

When it comes to enforcement, we may take various [actions](https://www.spotify.com/safetyandprivacy/content-actions/), including removing content or the creator, reducing distribution and/or demonetisation. When determining what action to take, we consider the potential risk of the content to lead to offline harm. Additional factors may also include:

*   Is there region-specific context or nuance?
*   Could this content increase the risk of offline harm?
*   What is the nature of the content (for example, is it news or a documentary? A comedy or satire?)
*   Is the speaker discussing their personally-lived experience?

Additionally, when users search for violent extremist content, they may be pointed to resource hubs that offer support for those who have been exposed to radicalising content. This material was created in partnership with third-party experts, including the [Spotify Safety Advisory Council](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2022-06-13/introducing-the-spotify-safety-advisory-council/), and encourages users to critically evaluate the content that they consume.

This space is nuanced, complex and always evolving. We are committed to iterating and improving upon our approach to keep violent extremist content off our platform. You can read more about our safety work [here](https://newsroom.spotify.com/safety-at-spotify/).

Understanding recommendations on Spotify
========================================

How do Spotify recommendations work?
------------------------------------

At Spotify, we aim to create great and unique experiences for each user. Our goal is to connect everyone with what they love and help them discover something new. No two listeners are the same, so everyone’s Spotify experience, and many of our recommendations, is personalised. When asked what they like about Spotify, most listeners cite our personalisation as their top feature. You might wonder how we generate these recommendations across the Home feed, playlists, search results or other parts of the service, and we want to help demystify how they work.

At Spotify, people and technology work together to deliver relevant recommendations. Some recommendations are based on editorial curation, like a pop playlist created by music editors. Other recommendations are tailored to each listener’s unique taste, like a personalised playlist powered by our expert-designed algorithms.

We believe recommendations shouldn’t just optimise for the next click, but evolve with your taste. We have dedicated teams in place making sure your recommendations enable real engagement and cultivate meaningful connections. We’re always working on improving our recommendation systems to make sure we’re showing you relevant and enjoyable content.

Editorial curation
------------------

Editors at Spotify use data insights, sharp ears and an understanding of cultural trends to place content where it’s likely to resonate most with fans around the world. They employ thoughtful curation to recommend content on Spotify, like in editorial playlists. Around the world, editors at Spotify have extensive knowledge about local music and culture, which allows them to make their programming decisions with the best listener experiences in mind.

Personalised recommendations
----------------------------

Spotify offers algorithmic recommendations that are relevant, unique and specific to each user. Our algorithms select and order content across each listener’s Spotify experience, including in Search, Home and in personalised playlists.

To make these recommendations, our algorithms rely on a number of inputs. The importance of these inputs may vary over time, depending on your individual use of Spotify. We believe that your taste profile is the most important input for creating the best overall user experience. Below, you’ll find more details on the most significant inputs and how they work.

### Your “taste profile”

As you engage with Spotify, actions such as searching, listening, skipping or saving to Your Library influence our interpretation of your taste. We call this your “taste profile”, and it gives our algorithms an indication of what you’re interested in and how you like to listen.

*   Example: If you listen to a certain artist, we might recommend more songs by that artist.
*   Example: Our Release Radar playlist recommends the latest releases we think you’ll enjoy based on similar music you’ve listened to.
*   Example: If you listen to a sports podcast, we might recommend other sports podcasts to you.

### Information you share with us

Recommendations are also based on information you share with Spotify, like your general (non-precise) location, your language, your age and who you follow. This gives our algorithms signals about what topics you’re interested in or which artists you want to keep up to date with.

*   Example: If you follow a certain podcast, we might recommend an episode from that podcast.
*   Example: If you choose German as your language on Spotify, we might recommend German-speaking podcasts.

### Trends

Our algorithms consider trends and the general tastes and behaviours of users to improve recommendations for everyone. When users take similar actions on certain content, our algorithms have more information about how people might want to interact with it.

*   Example: If many users interact with a specific search result (e.g. a song or a podcast), we are likely to recommend that result to other users who search for similar things.

### Information about the content

Our algorithms take into account the characteristics of the content itself, such as its genre, release date, podcast category, etc. This allows us to identify which content has similar characteristics and might be enjoyed by similar listeners.

*   Example: If you listen to a lot of pop music, we might recommend other pop songs that are similar.
*   Example: If you listen to a lot of crime audiobooks, we might recommend other crime audiobooks.

### Listener safety

As a platform, we evaluate the impact that we have on creators, listeners and communities. Spotify works to ensure that appropriate safety measures and processes are in place, including measures to prevent exposure to harmful content. We take [algorithmic responsibility](https://research.atspotify.com/algorithmic-responsibility/) seriously and collaborate between policy, product and research teams, as well as consult with external experts such as the [Spotify Safety Advisory Council](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2022-06-13/introducing-the-spotify-safety-advisory-council/).

Spotify’s [Platform Rules](https://www.spotify.com/safetyandprivacy/platform-rules/) apply to all content on the platform, including recommended content. These rules were developed by internal teams with input from a wide range of outside experts. When we become aware of potentially violating content, that content is reviewed against our policies and the appropriate [action](https://www.spotify.com/safetyandprivacy/content-actions/) will be taken. These actions include, for example, restricting the violating content from being recommended.

How can you influence what your recommendations are based on?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Your recommendations are constantly influenced by your engagement with content on Spotify. The more you listen to content you like and the more you interact with the app, the more we think you’ll enjoy your recommendations.

We also offer ways for you to influence and give feedback on what shows up in your recommendations and see less of something specific. Some examples are listed below:

*   **Exclude from taste profile:** When you [exclude a playlist](https://support.spotify.com/article/your-taste-profile/) from your taste profile, that playlist will have less influence on your future recommendations.
*   **Giving feedback on recommendations:** When you tap \[not interested/thumbs down\] for a recommendation on Spotify, you’ll be given fewer recommendations that are similar to it.
*   **Explicit content filter:** When you turn off [explicit content](https://support.spotify.com/article/explicit-content/), anything with an explicit tag will be greyed out and you won’t be able to play it.

In some cases, you can also organise and filter your recommendations based on what you most want to see. For example, you can filter your Home page to only see podcasts, or only see music.

How do commercial considerations impact recommendations?
--------------------------------------------------------

Spotify prioritises listener satisfaction when recommending content. In some cases, commercial considerations, such as the cost of content or whether we can monetise it, may influence our recommendations. For example, [Discovery Mode](https://artists.spotify.com/discovery-mode) gives artists and labels the opportunity to identify songs that are a priority for them, and our system will add that signal to the algorithms that determine the content of personalised listening sessions. When an artist or label turns on Discovery Mode for a song, Spotify charges a commission on streams of that song in areas of the platform where Discovery Mode is active (Discovery Mode is not active in our editorial playlists). This signal increases the likelihood of the selected songs being recommended, but does not guarantee it. We only recommend songs there is a high probability listeners will enjoy. As with all recommendations, we take note when a listener isn’t engaging with a song – including those in Discovery Mode – and factor this in when determining what to recommend in the future.

Digital Services Act points of contact
======================================

The Digital Services Act (“DSA”) regulates digital services that connect consumers with online content in the European Union (EU). A goal of the DSA is to create a safe environment online while ensuring that fundamental rights are protected.

Spotify operates a number of services that fall within scope of the Digital Services Act. The information listed on this page is intended to help Spotify users, creators and authorities within the EU communicate with Spotify, as stated in the DSA.

Spotify’s Digital Services Act Transparency Report
==================================================

The European Union’s Digital Services Act (DSA) is a regulation that aims to combat illegal content online.

Spotify’s Digital Services Act Transparency Report includes an overview of our approach, including policies, practices and actions related to users’ content across Spotify’s intermediary services. This report is essential for promoting transparency and accountability.

Spotify’s [Platform Rules](https://www.spotify.com/safetyandprivacy/platform-rules/) outline what is and is not allowed across our services. We consistently work to address illegal and harmful content uploaded by users while protecting users’ data and fundamental rights.

**Spotify’s Digital Services Act Transparency Report for 2024 can be found** **[here](https://www.spotify.com/safetyandprivacy/transparency/eu_20250213_dsa_report.pdf).**

Spotify’s Terrorist Content Online Transparency Report
======================================================

The European Union (EU) Terrorist Content Online Regulation (TCO) aims to uphold the safety and security of EU citizens by requiring digital services to remove terrorist content swiftly and effectively while respecting fundamental rights, such as freedom of expression.

Spotify works to combat harmful terrorist content if it is found to be on the platform. We collaborate with trusted authorities and partners to combat this industry-wide issue and constantly refine our internal processes to address evolving threats.

In compliance with the TCO, Spotify’s Terrorist Content Online Transparency Report outlines our efforts to prevent and stop terrorist content on our platform. This report gives an overview of our approach, including how we identify and enforce against terrorist content and respond to removal orders from national competent authorities in the EU.
