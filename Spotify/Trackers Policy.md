This policy describes how Spotify uses cookies. From now on, we'll call it the 'Policy'. The purpose of this Policy is to provide you, a user of Spotify's services and/or websites (we'll collectively call these the 'Services'), with clear information about the purposes for which Spotify uses cookies and the choices you have when it comes to managing your cookie settings.

[](#1-what-are-cookies)**1\. What are cookies?**
------------------------------------------------

Cookies are small pieces of text which are downloaded to your device, for example, when you visit a website. Cookies are useful because they allow Spotify and our partners to uniquely recognise your device and support the continuity of your experience, for example by helping us to understand your preferences or past actions. You can find more general information about cookies at: [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

[](#2-how-do-we-use-cookies)**2\. How do we use cookies?**
----------------------------------------------------------

Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving your user experience. They can also help to ensure that ads you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.

Spotify uses two main categories of cookie: (1) strictly necessary cookies; and (2) optional cookies:

#### [1\. Strictly Necessary Cookies](#1-strictly-necessary-cookies)

These cookies are set by Spotify or a third party on our behalf, and are essential to enable you to use the features of our Services, such as technically delivering content, setting your privacy preferences, logging in, making payments or filling in forms. Without these cookies, our Services cannot be provided so you cannot decline them.

#### [2\. Optional Cookies](#2-optional-cookies)

Optional cookies may be 'first party cookies' or 'third party cookies'. First party cookies set directly by Spotify or by a third party at our request. Third party cookies are set directly by a third party or set by Spotify at the request of a third party, such as our analytics or advertising service providers. You can see a list of these partners at this [link](https://www.spotify.com/legal/cookies-vendor-list/). Spotify, or our partners, use optional cookies in the following ways:

| Cookie Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Strictly Necessary Cookies | These cookies are essential in order to enable you to use the features of our Services, such as technically delivering content, setting your privacy preferences, logging in, making payments or filling in forms. Without these cookies, our Services cannot be provided so you cannot decline them. |
| Performance Cookies | These cookies collect information about how visitors use our Services. For example, these cookies allow us to count visits to our website and to understand how visitors found the website.<br><br>Web analytics that use cookies to gather data to enhance the performance of a website fall into this category. For example, they may be used for testing designs and ensuring a consistent look and feel is maintained for the user. We may also obtain information from our email newsletters or other communications we send to you, including whether you opened or forwarded a newsletter or clicked on any of its content. This information tells us about our newsletters' effectiveness and helps us ensure that we're delivering information that you find interesting.<br><br>This category does not include cookies used for behavioural/interest-based targeted advertising networks. |
| Functional | These cookies allow our Services to remember choices you make such as your user name, language or the region you are in and provide enhanced, more personal features and content. For example, these cookies can be used to remember changes you have made to parts of web pages that you can customise.<br><br>These cookies remember choices you make to improve your experience. If you do not allow these cookies then some of the choices you have made on previous visits to our Services will not be saved. |
| Targeting or advertising Cookies | These cookies collect information about your browsing habits in order to deliver advertisements more relevant to you and to understand your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertisements Spotify shares. These cookies log that you have visited a website and this information may be shared with other organisations such as advertisers. Additionally, Spotify may share limited data with other platforms to market Spotify promotions, features, or new releases on those other platforms. If you do not allow these cookies you will still experience advertising but it will be less tailored to you. |

[](#3-options-for-managing-cookies-and-interest-based-ads)**3\. Options for managing cookies and interest-based ads**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [](#web-browser-settings)**Web Browser Settings**

You can use your web browser settings to accept, refuse and delete cookies. To do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the 'Help', 'Tools' or 'Edit' settings).

Please note that if you set your browser to refuse cookies, you may not be able to use all the features of the Spotify website. To find out more information, you can visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

### [](#mobile-identifiers)**Mobile Identifiers**

On your mobile device, your operating system may provide you with additional options to opt out of interest based advertising or to otherwise reset your mobile identifiers. For example, you may use the 'Allow Apps to Request to Track' setting (on iOS devices) or the 'Opt out of Interest-Based Ads' setting (on Android devices). These settings allow you to limit the use of information about your use of apps for purposes of serving ads tailored to your interests.

### [](#interest-based-advertising)**Interest-Based Advertising**

You may opt-out of receiving interest-based advertisements by turning off the 'Tailored ads' toggle, located in the Privacy Settings page of your Spotify Account. If you opt-out of receiving interest-based ads using the Tailored ads toggle, Spotify will not share your information with third party advertising partners or use information received by them to show you interest-based ads. You may still receive ads when using the Services based on your Spotify registration information and your real-time usage of Spotify, but the ads may be less relevant to you.

Certain tailored advertisements that we, or a service provider acting on our behalf, display to you may include the 'Ad Choices' icon or another mechanism to opt out of receiving interest-based advertisements. You may click on the AdChoices icon or visit [www.aboutads.info](https://aboutads.info/) to:

*   learn more about the collection and use of information about your online activities for interest based advertising; or
*   opt out of having your data used for interest based advertising by Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) participating companies.

[](#4-updates-to-this-policy)**4\. Updates to this Policy**
-----------------------------------------------------------

We may occasionally make changes to this Policy.

When we make material changes to this Policy, we'll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances. For example, we may display a prominent notice within the Spotify Services or send you an email or device notification.
