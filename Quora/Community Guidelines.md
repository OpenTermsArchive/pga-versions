Quora is a place that empowers people to share and grow the world's knowledge. In order to provide everyone with a safe and authentic experience using Quora, the following types of content and behaviors are prohibited:

### [Spam](#h_01GFWFE6ZDSXXP7K9SXF1P0QYJ)

### [Hate Speech](#h_01GFWFFTT27SBF450C79BB9GCK)

Hate speech is defined as a serious attack on a group or individual based on their race, ethnicity, gender, national origin, sexual orientation, sex, religion, caste, serious medical condition, or disability.

Examples include:

    * Acts of physical violence towards others by civilians (excluding discussions about reasonable self defense as well as violence involving military actions).
    * Acts of physical violence towards others by other non-state actors, such as terrorist organizations.

Quora may also ban and remove all content from any user who is a confirmed and/or declared member of any group on the [U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations](https://www.state.gov/foreign-terrorist-organizations/), or is a confirmed participant in acts of mass violence or hate crimes.

### [Sexual Exploitation and Abuse](#h_01GFWFGARTMVHV7AD274X52AV1)

#### Children and Minors

Sexually explicit or suggestive content (written or visual) involving children and minors. **If child sexual abuse material is identified to us, we will remove it, report it to relevant authorities, and your account will be permanently banned.**

**Reporting - Please Speak Up:** If you think you've found a Quora account distributing or promoting sexually explicit or suggestive content involving children and minors, please report it to us using the in-product reporting tools. Please provide the username and links to all relevant content that led you to believe the account should be reviewed.

#### Animals

Sexually explicit or suggestive content (written or visual) involving animals with humans.

#### Adult

Sexually explicit graphic content involving adults which appears to be non-consensual or violent, as well as any content that promotes or glorifies non-consensual sexual activity.

### [Impersonation and Deceptive Activity](#h_01GFWFGWGH4VFA7RJ0SVJMFRE4)

Do not use Quora to impersonate another person, act as another entity without authorization, or create multiple accounts with the intention of violating Quora's policies. The use of multiple accounts to fake or manipulate engagement, engage in targeted user/content reporting, or to bypass or evade enforcement actions is not permitted.

### [Intellectual Property and Personal Rights](#h_01GFWFH4RWD9HN6R7KXSR5V82Y)

Do not post content that infringes any intellectual property or personal right of another party, including [copyright](https://www.quora.com/about/copyright), [trademark](https://www.quora.com/about/trademark), or privacy rights.

### [Profile Names](#h_01GFWFHEMX02PAC5VS7Y9BBJYX)

On Quora, you're free to choose what you wish to be called so long as your name doesn't contain explicit content or violate our platform policies. Many people on Quora choose to use their real name to provide legitimacy to the content they post and establish a sense of trust with the community.

Profile names may not contain the following:

* Profanities, slurs, or other obscenities.
* Sexually explicit language
* Phone numbers
* Any content that violates our existing platform policies

If you believe your profile name was flagged incorrectly, please submit a request at [quora.com/contact](http://quora.com/contact). On the contact form, select "I want to appeal a moderation decision" and then select "Flagged Name" as the reason for your appeal.

#### Special Cases

* **Company or organizational accounts**: You may create an account on Quora to represent a legally incorporated business or other organization. You are not required to do so if you prefer to answer using a personal account. Not all organization accounts will be verified, though we may ask company accounts to provide verification. For more information about creating company accounts on Quora, see: [https://quoraadsupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061083132-Create-a-Business-Profile](https://quoraadsupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061083132-Create-a-Business-Profile)
* **Titles:** We encourage you to include titles such as "Dr." and "Ms." and information about degrees (e.g., "M.D.", or "PhD.") as a [credential](https://help.quora.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015675451-How-can-I-add-credentials-on-Quora-) as opposed to as part of your profile name.

### [Using the Quora brand/logo](#h_01GFWFJ7PFDSHW8TBHNSNGAS0Q)

Using the Quora brand name or logo (or variations) without authorization is prohibited.

### [Adult Content](#h_01GFWFJJBR7GEVKK9PZ6NCZS48)

Adult content in answers is only allowed when the question references an adult topic, which will restrict its distribution. Similarly, Adult content is only allowed in Spaces that are tagged as ‘Adult’. Adult content is not permitted in profile pictures, Space icons/cover photos, and topic images as these images appear throughout the site. Images for sex-related topics must be similar to images you would find in a medical/anatomy textbook and altogether not sexually graphic or explicit. We also prohibit adult content in profile names, profile descriptions, and credentials.

Quora defines adult content as any content (e.g., writing, imagery, or video) that is pornographic, depicts a sexual act, or is otherwise overtly sexual. [Learn more](https://help.quora.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405052142868-What-is-considered-Adult-content-on-Quora-).

Questions and Answers Policies
==============================

Official Quora Account

* 2024-04-18T23:32:25Z

Questions and answers must adhere to Quora’s Platform Policies, as well as the additional policies outlined below:

### The following are Quora’s policies for posting questions:

* Questions are viewed as community property.
* A question can be merged into another question if both ask the same thing.
* Quora requires correct spelling, punctuation, grammar and capitalization to be used in questions.

**Note**: Questions that are merely badly formatted or unclear will be tagged for improvement rather than removed.  
  
If you feel your question has been incorrectly deleted, please use this [contact form](https://help.quora.com/hc/requests/new?ticket_form_id=198746) to submit an appeal.

### The following are Quora’s policies for writing answers:

* Answers should respond to the question asked.
* A user should **disclose any** [relevant affiliations](https://help.quora.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055133711) explicitly in an answer or in the [credential](https://help.quora.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005507963) that appears with the answer. Affiliate links are not allowed.
* Self-promotional links or self-promotion that does not form a part of a direct and helpful response to the question is not allowed.
* The gist of the answer should be able to be understood without having to leave Quora to access an external website. Answers that cannot be understood without navigating to an external site and appear to be doing so for promotional purposes may be collapsed and/or removed.

What is Quora's policy on adding images and videos?
===================================================

Official Quora Account

* 2022-09-27T20:21:17Z

The following is Quora's policy on adding images and videos to answers, posts, comments, topic pages, user profiles, and other areas of the site:  
  
**Adult Media**

Adult images and videos (including graphic violence and sex-related media) are only allowed on adult Spaces and pages involving adult topics and which have been tagged with the appropriate Quora Adult topic(s) (e.g., [Specific Types of Adult Content](https://www.quora.com/topic/Specific-Types-of-Content "www.quora.com"), [Sex](https://www.quora.com/topic/Sex "www.quora.com") and/or other topics). This will [limit the distribution](https://help.quora.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000839663 "www.quora.com") to users who have actively opted in to seeing such content.  
  
Because user [profile pictures](https://help.quora.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004231606 "www.quora.com"), Space icons/cover photos, and topic images appear throughout the site, sex-related image content is _not_ permitted in these areas.  
  
**Graphic Violence**

Images and videos of extreme graphic violence (or links to such images/videos) are only allowed if (1) they are clearly helpful and necessary to the answer, and (2) they do not glorify violence. Questions that specifically ask for pictures of graphic violence must have the [Adult Content on Quora](https://www.quora.com/topic/Adult-Content-on-Quora-1 "www.quora.com") topic tag applied.

What is Quora's policy on credentials?
======================================

Official Quora Account

* 2022-09-27T20:19:52Z

Please note that this policy does not apply to Quora [Spaces](https://help.quora.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020402511-Spaces-Frequently-Asked-Questions). To learn more about our policies for Spaces & Space content, please see: [Spaces Policies](https://help.quora.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043961972)

Profile and topic [credentials](https://help.quora.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005507963) are short descriptions of your expertise, experience, or interests that are shown next to your name on answers. Credentials must be true and helpful.

A good credential helps:

* Others understand who you are and why you're a good person to answer the question
* Others decide which questions to [ask you to answer](https://help.quora.com/hc/en-us/articles/360057977972 "www.quora.com")
* Your answers get more views

Topic credentials should:

* Be true, helpful, and describe a personal connection to a topic, in a way that an average reader can understand
* Be understandable without the topic name

* "Seen hundreds of movies" is a good bio for Movies, but "Seen hundreds of them" is not. People don't see the topic name next to bios. In a question about Operas and Movies, "them" is ambiguous
* "10 years living in the Bay Area" is a good credential for the San Francisco Bay Area topic, but "lived here" is ambiguous.

* Describe your expertise, experience, or interest in the topic

* Expertise: "Director of Pulp Fiction"
* Experience: "Seen hundreds of movies at film festivals"
* Interest: "Loves watching Christopher Nolan's films"

Profile credentials should:

* Be true, helpful, and describe a personal connection to at least one topic area which a person could write about
* Can be a general description of your expertise, experience, or interests

* "Artist and novelist from the Pacific Northwest"
* "Theoretical physicist, American expat in Germany"

* Personal descriptions, statements of values, and/or personal philosophies are acceptable only if they relate to a specific topic area

Credentials that don't meet the above criteria will be flagged by Quora Moderation and hidden until the user edits and improves them. If you think your credential adheres to the above policy and has been wrongly hidden, please use this [contact form](https://help.quora.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=198746) to submit your appeal.

What is Quora's policy for posting reviews of businesses, products, or services?
================================================================================

Official Quora Account

* 2022-09-27T20:16:45Z

Please note that this policy does not apply to Quora [Spaces](https://help.quora.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020402511-Spaces-Frequently-Asked-Questions). To learn more about our policies for Spaces & Space content, please see: [Spaces Policies](https://help.quora.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043961972)

Reviews are inputs about one's experience with a business, product, or service. Reviews can be a source of valuable information that can help people evaluate and make better choices for their own situation.

In order to provide the most useful experience to others, reviews on Quora:

1. Should state the basis for any opinions expressed
2. Should be based on the writer's actual experience
3. Should disclose if the writer is affiliated with the party being reviewed or a competitor, or received monetary compensation or other reward for posting

Quora may remove reviews that do not meet these guidelines.

What is Quora's policy on disclosing affiliations in answers?
=============================================================

Official Quora Account

* 2022-09-27T20:25:32Z

Please note that this policy does not apply to Quora [Spaces](https://help.quora.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020402511-Spaces-Frequently-Asked-Questions). To learn more about our policies for Spaces & Space content, please see: [Spaces Policies](https://help.quora.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043961972)

A user should **disclose any relevant affiliations** explicitly in an answer or in the [credential](https://help.quora.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005507963) that appears with the answer.

For example, if a user writes an answer about his own company or product, the answer (or [answer credential](https://help.quora.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015675451 "www.quora.com")) should make clear the user's affiliation with the company. This disclosure can be brief and does not need to be set off separately, as long as it is clear.

A relevant affiliation is **any involvement that a reasonable observer would think is important for interpreting the views that the user expresses in an answer**. Affiliations can include: financial interests and investments; memberships (e.g., being an alumnus of a school or a member of a club), or a personal history relevant to the answer (e.g., you are involved in a lawsuit with the company you are writing about). The general rule in close cases is: when in doubt as to whether an affiliation is relevant, a user should disclose it.

Otherwise, answers about something the writer is affiliated with are held to the same standards of helpfulness, explanation, and accuracy as other answers on the site.

What is Quora's policy on plagiarism and attribution?
=====================================================

Answers and posts that copy or paraphrase content from other sources should:

* **Explicitly attribute the source.** If the source is online, you should include a link to the page where the content can be found. If it is a physical source (e.g., a book), you should include a citation.
* **Clearly indicate which portions of the text are copied from another source.** Format using blockquotes, quotes, or otherwise visually indicate which portions are taken from elsewhere.

Quora's strong preference is for people to use blockquote formatting for long excerpts. If you are republishing your own content from another site, you may omit blockquote formatting and cite the original publication at the end of your answer/post.  
   
Answers and posts that plagiarize content from other sources will be collapsed. Note that repeatedly posting the same answer to multiple questions will be considered spam, particularly if the answer isn't customized for each question.

**Other content**  
Topic and Space descriptions, as well as other community-editable descriptions on Quora, should be predominantly original and should not copy-and-paste from other sites (e.g., Wikipedia).  
   
Plagiarizing content is considered a serious policy violation on Quora and will be treated as such in considering moderation action against writers who violate the policy. Quora may ban people who repeatedly violate this policy.

Quora defines adult content as any content (e.g., writing, imagery, or video) that is pornographic, depicts a sexual act, or is otherwise overtly sexual. Below are some examples of adult content:

**Examples of content that is considered adult:**

* Videos of intercourse or sexual acts
* Depictions of sexual acts, including anime or cartoon depictions or sex scene captures from movies, regardless of nudity being displayed
* Provocative, sexually explicit content including sexual fetishes or graphic language that is not educational in nature (e.g., detailed descriptions of performing sexual acts)
* Nudity, such as images of nude adults, without an educational or newsworthy purpose
* Sexually explicit or suggestive jokes
* Images that overly focused on intimate body parts (e.g. the crotch) even if clothed
* Non-professional media depicting individuals posing provocatively in underwear and/or transparent clothing in private settings
* Non-educational discussion of pornographic websites

**Examples of content that is _not_ considered adult:**

* Videos of breasts with post-mastectomy scarring, a parent breastfeeding their child
* Artwork that contains nudity including paintings, sculptures, and photographs that have artistic merit and whose primary purpose isn’t to create sexual arousal
* Tribal nudity - for example, uncontacted people of the Amazon shared for educational purpose.
* Professional photoshoots depicting models in branded lingerie or swimwear
* Discussions of puberty or sexual education
* Testimonies from victims of sexual violence
* Broad discussion about sex industries using academic terms

**Examples of Spaces that are considered adult:**

* Spaces explicitly tagged as adult
* Spaces about sex work, images of nude adults, pornographic content and how to obtain any of the aforementioned
* Spaces that encourage posting, sharing, or viewing of sexually explicit content via the Space name, description, and/or details, including by using keywords such as "hot", "sexy", "alluring", "sultry", "jaw-dropping"
* Spaces containing several posts that are ‘adult’
* Spaces predominantly dedicated to sharing sexually explicit humor

**Examples of Spaces that are not considered adult:**

* Spaces where women are discussing breast feeding tips and best practices
* Spaces offering support for victims of sexual violence

How does Quora intend to enforce the "Not for Reproduction" feature?
====================================================================

You can enforce this the same way you'd enforce someone copying a blog post you wrote on a personal blog.

Quora's goal with the "Not for Reproduction" clause is just to give users the right to opt out of the default case and prevent reproduction of their content outside of Quora.

If someone copies your content and somehow isn't able to stop a hosting provider from distributing it (as in the case of a website which they are not an admin) you could send the hosting provider a DMCA (Digital Millenia Copyright Act) takedown notice - this will legally obligate the hosting provider to take the content down. Please note that a DMCA claim only applies when the hosting provider is located within the United States.
