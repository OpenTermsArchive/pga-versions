### [Profile Names](#h_01GFWFHEMX02PAC5VS7Y9BBJYX)

On Quora, you're free to choose what you wish to be called so long as your name doesn't contain explicit content or violate our platform policies. Many people on Quora choose to use their real name to provide legitimacy to the content they post and establish a sense of trust with the community.

Profile names may not contain the following:

* Profanities, slurs, or other obscenities.
* Sexually explicit language
* Phone numbers
* Any content that violates our existing platform policies

If you believe your profile name was flagged incorrectly, please submit a request at [quora.com/contact](http://quora.com/contact). On the contact form, select "I want to appeal a moderation decision" and then select "Flagged Name" as the reason for your appeal.

#### Special Cases

* **Company or organizational accounts**: You may create an account on Quora to represent a legally incorporated business or other organization. You are not required to do so if you prefer to answer using a personal account. Not all organization accounts will be verified, though we may ask company accounts to provide verification. For more information about creating company accounts on Quora, see: [https://quoraadsupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061083132-Create-a-Business-Profile](https://quoraadsupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061083132-Create-a-Business-Profile)

### [Using the Quora brand/logo](#h_01GFWFJ7PFDSHW8TBHNSNGAS0Q)

Using the Quora brand name or logo (or variations) without authorization is prohibited.

### [Adult Content](#h_01GFWFJJBR7GEVKK9PZ6NCZS48)

Adult content in answers is only allowed when the question references an adult topic, which will restrict its distribution. Similarly, Adult content is only allowed in Spaces that are tagged as ‘Adult’. Adult content is not permitted in profile pictures, Space icons/cover photos, and topic images as these images appear throughout the site. Images for sex-related topics must be similar to images you would find in a medical/anatomy textbook and altogether not sexually graphic or explicit.

Quora defines adult content as any content (e.g., writing, imagery, or video) that is pornographic, depicts a sexual act, or is otherwise overtly sexual. [Learn more](https://help.quora.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405052142868-What-is-considered-Adult-content-on-Quora-).
