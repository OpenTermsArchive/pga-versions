Privacy Policy
--------------

*   Effective since last update: **\[12/09/2025\]**

This policy describes the information we process to support the UpScrolled platform. Additional tools and information can be found in the UpScrolled app settings.

1\. Information We Collect
--------------------------

The data gathered while utilising the UpScrolled platform can be categorised into two distinct groups.

1.1. Information you provide us.
--------------------------------

When registering, you are required to provide information essential for platform usage. This includes a display name (e.g., “User”), a handle (e.g., @User), a password, an email address, and your date of birth. Your date of birth is never displayed to other users and is used solely to verify your age in accordance with our [Terms of Service](https://upscrolled.com/en/terms-of-service/).

You may also provide additional information in your bio. While profile information such as your display name, bio, and handle is always publicly visible, you may choose to use either your real name or a pseudonym.

Preferences are also collected when you customise your settings, enabling us to respect your choices accordingly.

1.2. Information we collect when you use UpScrolled app.
--------------------------------------------------------

When using the UpScrolled platform, we may gather information regarding your usage patterns to enhance functionality, maintain security, uphold respectfulness, and tailor the experience to your preferences.

**Usage Information**. This encompasses various aspects of your activity on UpScrolled, including:

*   Posts and other content you generate, alongside details like posting date and the UpScrolled app version used.
*   Interactions with content from other users, such as shares, likes, downloads, bookmarks, comments, as well as instances where you or others are mentioned or tagged.
*   Your engagements with fellow platform users, including those you follow, those who follow you, and metadata associated with messages.
*   Communication with us via email, with relevant information collected regarding the interaction and its content.
*   Tracking of links interacted with across the platform, including those embedded in emails sent to you.
*   The utilisation of various components of the platform, including the video or photo editor, user journey analytics, and other features, may entail the collection of data even if it is not necessarily identifiable.

**  
Device Information**. We may collect data pertaining to the devices you employ to access UpScrolled, covering:

*   Connection details such as IP address, browser type, and related parameters.
*   Device specifics like type, operating system, carrier, language, and memory capacity configurations.
*   Location Information: We may collect information about your approximate location, derived from your IP address. This information is not precise and may indicate details such as your country, city, or district. This is a standard practice to support core platform functions.

**  
Inferred Identity Information**. We might gather or receive data used to deduce your identity, including:

*   Device association with your account upon signing in, and potential linkage with other devices based on settings.
*   Use of provided information (e.g., email addresses) to establish connections with your UpScrolled account, potentially inferring additional identity details based on shared components.
*   Identity inference when accessing UpScrolled without signing in, based on collected information.

**  
Log Information**. Even if you haven’t created an account or are signed out, we may receive information when you interact with our platform, including:

*   IP address, browser details, operating system, referral sources, access times, visited pages, approximate location data, mobile carrier details and device identifiers.
*   Cookies and Similar Technologies: We employ cookies and similar tools for enhanced website usage data collection and platform operation, albeit not mandatory for many platform functions like searches and viewing public profiles.

**  
Crash Reports and Diagnostics**. We use third-party service to collect crash reports and diagnostic information to improve the functionality and performance of our app. This section explains what data we collect, how we use it, and how we ensure compliance with privacy regulations.

*   Device Information: Model, operating system version, and app version.
*   Crash Details: Error messages, stack traces, and data about the actions leading to the crash. They do not include your personal message content, photos, videos, or the contents of device memory.
*   User Interactions: Information about how the app was being used when the crash occurred.
*   Anonymized Identifiers: Randomly generated user or session IDs (when applicable).

2\. How We Use Information
--------------------------

Describing how we utilise the information we gather can be complex due to the intricacies of our platform’s operational systems. Nonetheless, we’ve identified five primary ways in which we leverage this information, aimed at enhancing your experience while maintaining transparency. If you have any unanswered questions, feel free to [contact](https://upscrolled.com/en/contact/) us.

2.1. Operate, Improve, and Personalise Services
-----------------------------------------------

We may utilise collected data to operate the UpScrolled platform effectively. This includes enhancing and customising your experience by providing more relevant content, suggesting connections, and refining our algorithms (if applicable). Your control over personalised content is paramount, and you can adjust these settings within your account preferences. Additionally, your contact information may aid others in locating your account, subject to your settings. If you do not see such settings in your account preferences, it indicates that we are not employing such methods yet.

2.2. Foster Safety and Security
-------------------------------

Ensuring the safety and security of our users, platform, and your account is of utmost importance. We employ collected information to verify identities, authenticate accounts, and safeguard against fraudulent activities and unauthorised use. Furthermore, we assess and maintain the safety and quality of content on UpScrolled by enforcing policies, terms, and applicable laws.

2.3. Measure, Analyse, and Improve Services
-------------------------------------------

Collected data is utilised to measure and analyse the platform’s effectiveness and user behaviour, aiding in its continuous improvement. Understanding how you interact with UpScrolled helps us enhance its functionality and user experience.

2.4. Communicate Platform Updates
---------------------------------

We use gathered information to keep you informed about platform updates, policy changes, and terms revisions, ensuring transparency and clarity in our communication with users.

2.5. Research
-------------

Information shared with us or collected is utilised for research, surveys, product testing, and troubleshooting purposes. This assists us in refining and enhancing the overall operation of the platform.  
  
The platform will handle the data in compliance with the applicable regulations outlined in the General Data Protection Regulation ((EU) 2016/679) (“GDPR”).  
  
By delineating these key usage areas, we aim to provide clarity on how your information contributes to the functionality and integrity of the UpScrolled platform.

3\. Sharing Information
-----------------------

Understanding how we share your information, why we do so, and how you can control it is crucial. There are three main ways we share your information:

3.1. When You Post and Share
----------------------------

*   With the General Public: By posting content on UpScrolled, you’re consenting to its disclosure to the widest audience possible. This includes your profile information (e.g., name/pseudonym, handle, profile pictures), which can be viewed by anyone, even those not signed in to UpScrolled. Additionally, UpScrolled content may appear in search engine results outside of the platform.
*   With Other UpScrolled Users: Depending on your settings, we may share interactions you have with other users’ content, such as likes, and the people you choose to follow.

3.2. With Third Parties & Third-Party Integrations
--------------------------------------------------

We use service providers to host, process, and analyse data on our behalf under strict data processing agreements. They may not use your data for their own purposes. Categories include cloud hosting, content delivery, analytics, crash reporting, and customer support.

3.3. When Required by Law, to Prevent Harm, or in the Public Interest
---------------------------------------------------------------------

We may disclose or preserve information only when required by valid Australian legal process. This includes:

*   Non-content data in response to a subpoena, court order, or similar lawful process.
*   Content data only with a search warrant or equivalent issued by an Australian authority with jurisdiction.
*   Foreign government requests, which must first proceed through a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) or another recognized channel that results in valid Australian legal process.
*   Emergencies involving an imminent risk of death or serious harm, where we may disclose the minimum necessary information.
*   Address fraud, security, or technical issues.
*   Safeguard the safety of individuals or the integrity of our platform, including prevention of spam, abuse, or malicious activity.
*   Provide explanations for content or account removals.
*   Protect our rights, property, or the rights and property of our users.

4\. How Long We Keep Information
--------------------------------

We maintain different types of information for varying durations:

4.1. Profile Information and Content
------------------------------------

We retain your profile information and usage data, including the content you post, your interactions with others, and how you engage with content on the platform, for the duration of your account’s existence or until such content is removed. Retaining this information is necessary in order to provide you with access to our products and services.

4.2. Communication Records
--------------------------

When you communicate with us, for example by email, we retain records of the communication and its content for up to 18 months. In some cases, we may keep this information longer if it is necessary to meet our legal obligations or to establish, exercise, or defend legal rights.

4.3. Violation of Rules
-----------------------

In cases where you violate our rules and your account is suspended, we may retain the identifiers used to create the account (e.g., email address) indefinitely. This measure aims to prevent repeat policy offenders from creating new accounts.

4.4. Legal Compliance and Safety
--------------------------------

Upon a valid preservation request or legal hold, we retain only the specific data necessary for the required period; otherwise, our standard retention schedule applies.

4.5. Other data points
----------------------

Operational and diagnostic data such as crash reports, error logs, and related technical information are retained solely for functionality, performance, and security purposes. These records are not used to identify users and are stored for a maximum of 12 months, after which they are deleted.

4.6. Public Content Reminder
----------------------------

It’s important to note that public content may persist elsewhere even after removal or dissociation from the UpScrolled platform. Search engines and other third parties may retain copies of your posts for extended periods, governed by their own privacy policies.

By outlining these data retention practices, we aim to uphold transparency and accountability regarding the storage and handling of user information on the UpScrolled platform. If you have any concerns or questions regarding data retention, please feel free to [contact](https://upscrolled.com/en/contact/) us.

5\. Take Control
----------------

5.1. Access, Correction, Portability
------------------------------------

You maintain the ability to access, correct, or amend the information you have provided to us by editing your profile and adjusting your account settings.

To ensure privacy protection and security maintenance, we may take measures to verify your identity before granting access to your personal information or fulfilling requests for deletion, portability, or other related actions. In certain instances, we may decline access, correction, or portability requests, particularly if identity verification is unsuccessful.

At present, we do not yet offer a self-service download tool for your data; however, this functionality will be made available in a future update.

5.2. Deleting Your Information
------------------------------

Through your account settings, you have the option to request the deletion of your account. Upon initiating such a request, your account and associated data will be promptly  
queued for deletion. A confirmation email will be sent to you once the deletion process is completed. While physical deletion may take some time, data association linked to your account will be promptly removed from our service where feasible and become inaccessible by other users or public.

5.3. Authorised Agent Requests
------------------------------

If you are an authorised agent seeking to submit a request related to access, modification, or deletion of your information, or that of another individual on their behalf, you may also  
[contact](https://upscrolled.com/en/contact/) us. Additional information may be required for verification purposes to process such requests.

6\. Your Rights and Ours
------------------------

We offer UpScrolled to users worldwide and extend many privacy tools and controls universally. However, your experience may vary slightly depending on your location to ensure compliance with local regulations.

6.1. Legal Bases for Data Usage
-------------------------------

UpScrolled has meticulously identified the legal grounds enabling the collection, usage, sharing, and processing of your information. It’s important to note that we do not engage in the sale of your personal information.

6.2. Data Movement to Support UpScrolled Functionality
------------------------------------------------------

UpScrolled facilitates seamless global interactions among users from diverse countries. To ensure the smooth and reliable operation of our service, information needs to be transferred across borders and between different countries. For instance, if you’re conversing with someone in Europe or the United States while residing in a Middle Eastern country, data must traverse these regions to facilitate the interaction, aligning with your expectations.  
  
Additionally, we leverage data centres and cloud providers situated across various parts of the world to bolster our service delivery. However, our primary aim is to physically store data within Ireland. This approach enables us to maintain consistency in our service while prioritising data protection and privacy compliance.

7\. UpScrolled’s Audience
-------------------------

Our platform is not intended for children, and individuals under the age of 16 are prohibited from using it. Moreover, users must be of legal age to consent to the processing of their personal data in their respective countries. In certain jurisdictions, we may permit a parent or guardian to provide consent on behalf of a minor.

8\. Changes To This Privacy Policy
----------------------------------

The latest edition of this Privacy Policy regulates our handling of your personal data, and we reserve the right to update it as necessary. Should revisions occur, and if we deem the changes to be significant, we will notify you and offer the opportunity to review the updated Privacy Policy before you proceed with using UpScrolled.

9\. General
-----------

The UpScrolled Privacy Policy is currently available in both Arabic and English. While we endeavour to ensure the accuracy of translations with future updates, in the event of any discrepancies or inconsistencies, the English versions of the UpScrolled Privacy Policy will prevail. You acknowledge that Arabic or English shall serve as the authoritative language for interpreting and constructing the terms of the UpScrolled Privacy Policy.

10\. How To Contact UpScrolled
------------------------------

### غابرييلا بورد

الشريك المؤسِّس لشركة DNA

بالنسبة لغابرييلا بورد، يبدأ الاتصال الحقيقي بالحقيقة غير المقيّدة. بصفتها الشريكة المؤسسة لشركة [DNA](https://www.dna.online/) — وكالة المحتوى والمنصّة المخصّصة للعلامات التجارية — تساعد الشركات على توسيع منظوماتها الخاصة بالمحتوى. ومع ذلك، فإن رحلتها الريادية، التي شملت تأسيس كل شيء من وكالات محتوى إلى شركة مروحيات، أظهرت لها كيف تعطي المنصات التقليدية الأولوية للربح على حساب الناس. لهذا السبب فهي أيضًا شريك إستراتيجي لأبسكرولد، حيث تسهم في إنشاء فضاءات رقمية تتيح للمجتمعات المهمَّشة مشاركة حقيقتها بلا قيود أو خوف.

وبفضل عملها مع علامات تجارية عالمية، إلى جانب دفاعها عن الحقوق الفلسطينية في الأوساط المهنية، تدرك غابرييلا قوة السرد الأصيل. فهي تدعم روّاد الأعمال والمبدعين والمجتمعات التي ترفض أن يُخرسها التحيّز الخوارزمي أو الرقابة الخفية.
