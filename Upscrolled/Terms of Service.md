Terms of Service
----------------

*   Effective since last update: **\[20/01/2026\]**

These Terms of Service (“Terms”) form an integral component of the User Agreement, a legally binding contract that regulates your utilisation of the UpScrolled Platform. While it’s essential to peruse these Terms thoroughly, here are some crucial points to note:

*   When engaging with the Services, including posting Content, you are obligated to adhere to both this User Agreement and the relevant laws. Your usage of the Services and the Content you produce are your responsibility. You must adhere to the User Agreement, its associated policies, and all pertinent regulations.
*   It’s imperative to comply with the acceptable use terms of the Services, meaning you must access them solely through the officially provided interfaces. This prohibits actions such as scraping data or attempting to circumvent technical constraints, which could disrupt the Services.
*   UpScrolled retains the right to enforce these terms and take necessary actions if violations occur, including removing Content, restricting visibility, or terminating access to the UpScrolled platform. Additionally, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts for reasons like extended inactivity, legal risk, or commercial impracticality.
*   Intellectual property licences are outlined in these Terms, ensuring that while you maintain ownership of your posted Content, you grant us a broad, royalty-free licence to share it with others. Conversely, we grant you a licence to use our provided software, such as the UpScrolled mobile application, solely for enjoying the Services.
*   Your use of the Services is at your own risk, provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis, with disclaimers of warranties, responsibilities, and liabilities to the extent permitted by law. You may encounter offensive or harmful content posted by other users, and the Services may evolve over time, with features being limited or terminated at our discretion.
*   While you have remedies and redress mechanisms available, our liability is limited, as detailed in the agreement. You retain the right to terminate this agreement by deactivating your account. Note that we are not liable for certain damages, and our aggregate liability is capped.

Please be aware that these Terms incorporate our [Privacy Policy](https://upscrolled.com/en/privacy-policy/) and other applicable terms. Additionally, variations may apply based on your location, but regardless, you must be at least 16 years old to utilise the UpScrolled platform.

The UpScrolled User Agreement encompasses these Terms of Service, our [Privacy Policy](https://upscrolled.com/en/privacy-policy/), our [Rules and Policies](https://upscrolled.com/en/rules-and-policies/), and all integrated policies.

UpScrolled Terms of Service
---------------------------

The following Terms of Service (“Terms”) regulate your utilisation of our services, encompassing our mobile applications, website, APIs, email notifications, buttons, widgets, and any other covered services that are linked to these Terms (collectively referred to as the “Services”). Additionally, these Terms govern any information, text, links, graphics, photos, audio, videos, or other materials uploaded, downloaded, or displayed on the Services (referred to as “Content”). Your use of the Services indicates your agreement to abide by these Terms.

These Terms constitute an agreement between you and Recursive Methods Pty Ltd., the provider of the UpScrolled platform and its associated Services, located at 81-83 Campbell Street, Surry Hills NSW 2010, Australia. Throughout these Terms, the terms “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Recursive Methods Pty Ltd.

1\. Eligibility to Use the Services
-----------------------------------

You may use the Services only if you consent to enter into a legally binding contract with us and are not prohibited from receiving services under the laws of the relevant jurisdiction. Regardless, you must be at least 16 years old to utilise the Services. If you are agreeing to these Terms and accessing the Services on behalf of a company, organisation, government entity, or any other legal entity, you affirm and warrant that you have the authority to do so and to legally bind such entity to these Terms. In such instances, the terms “you” and “your” in these Terms shall refer to said entity.

2\. Privacy
-----------

We adhere to our [Privacy Policy](https://upscrolled.com/en/privacy-policy/), which outlines how we manage the information you provide us when utilising the Services. By using the Services, you acknowledge that you consent to the collection and utilisation of this information, as detailed in the Privacy Policy. This includes the potential transfer of such information to any country for storage, processing, and utilisation by us and our service providers.

3\. Content on the Services
---------------------------

You are accountable for your utilisation of the Services and for any Content you contribute, ensuring compliance with relevant laws, rules, and regulations. It’s essential to only provide Content that you’re comfortable sharing publicly with others.

Any reliance on or use of Content or materials posted via the Services, or obtained by you through the Services, is at your own risk. We do not endorse, support, represent, or guarantee the completeness, truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any Content or communications posted via the Services, nor do we endorse any opinions expressed therein. By utilising the Services, you acknowledge the potential exposure to Content that may be offensive, harmful, inaccurate, or otherwise inappropriate, including mislabelled or deceptive postings. The responsibility for all Content lies solely with the individual originating it. We may not monitor or control Content posted via the Services, and therefore cannot assume responsibility for such Content.

We reserve the right to remove any Content that violates the User Agreement, including but not limited to copyright or trademark violations, impersonation, unlawful conduct, or harassment.

If you believe your Content has been copied in a manner constituting copyright infringement, please report it by [contacting](https://upscrolled.com/en/contact/) us.

Your Rights and Grant of Rights in the Content
----------------------------------------------

You retain ownership rights to any Content you submit, post, or display on or through the Services. Your Content, including incorporated audio, photos, and videos, remains yours.

By submitting, posting, or displaying Content on or through the Services, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free licence (with the right to sublicence) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display, and distribute such Content through any and all media or distribution methods, whether currently known or developed in the future (including curating, transforming, and translating). This licence permits us to share your Content with the world and allows others to do the same. You agree that this licence extends to our provision, promotion, and improvement of the Services, as well as making Content submitted through the Services available to other entities for syndication, broadcast, distribution, reposting, promotion, or publication on other media and services, subject to our terms and conditions for such Content use. No compensation is owed to you for such additional uses, as your use of the Services is deemed sufficient compensation for the Content and grant of rights herein.

You affirm that you have obtained all necessary rights, licences, consents, permissions, power, and/or authority required to grant the rights outlined herein for any Content you submit, post, or display on or through the Services. You further agree that such Content will not infringe upon copyright or other proprietary rights unless you possess the requisite permissions or are otherwise legally entitled to post the material and grant us the aforementioned licence.

4\. Using the Services
----------------------

Please review our [Rules and Policies](https://upscrolled.com/en/rules-and-policies/), which are integral to the User Agreement and outline prohibited conduct on the Services. Your use of the Services must comply with these Terms as well as all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. UpScrolled takes enforcement actions when Content or user behaviour violates our [Rules and Policies](https://upscrolled.com/en/rules-and-policies/) or pertains to sensitive media.

The Services undergo constant evolution. Consequently, we reserve the right, at our discretion, to modify the Services or any of its features, either permanently or temporarily, and may discontinue providing certain Services or features to you or users in general. We also retain the authority to impose limitations on usage and storage at our sole discretion. Moreover, we may remove or decline to distribute any Content on the Services, restrict its distribution or visibility, suspend or terminate user accounts, and reclaim usernames without incurring liability to you.

We reserve the right to access, review, retain, and disclose any information that we reasonably believe is necessary to: (i) comply with applicable laws, regulations, legal processes, or governmental requests; (ii) enforce these Terms, including investigating potential violations; (iii) detect, prevent, or address fraud, security issues, or technical concerns; (iv) respond to user support inquiries; or (v) safeguard the rights, property, or safety of UpScrolled, its users, and the public. Personally-identifiable information is not disclosed to third parties except as stipulated in our [Privacy Policy](https://upscrolled.com/en/privacy-policy/).

Your Account
------------

To access the Services, you may need to create an account. It is your responsibility to safeguard your account by using a robust password and restricting its usage to yourself. We cannot be held liable for any loss or damage resulting from your failure to comply with these security measures.

While you have control over most communications from the Services, certain essential communications such as service announcements and administrative messages may be necessary and cannot be opted out of. If you have linked an email address to your account and later change, deactivate, or lose access to that email, it is your responsibility to promptly update your account information. Failure to do so may result in missed communications, limited access to your account, or difficulties with account recovery.

Your Licence to Use the Services
--------------------------------

We grant you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, and non-exclusive licence to use the software provided as part of the Services. This licence is solely intended to enable you to utilise and benefit from the Services as offered on the UpScrolled platform, in accordance with these Terms.

The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of Australia and other countries. Nothing in these Terms grants you the right to use the UpScrolled name or any UpScrolled or Recursive Methods Pty Ltd. trademarks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features. All rights, titles, and interests in and to the Services (excluding Content provided by users) are and will remain our exclusive property or that of our licensors. Any feedback, comments, or suggestions you provide regarding UpScrolled or the Services are voluntary, and we may use such feedback without obligation to you.

Mobile Application Terms
------------------------

If you access the Services through a mobile application downloaded from any third-party application distribution platform (including but not limited to the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, or any other distribution platform) (each, an “App Provider”), the following additional terms apply:

(a) **Scope of Agreement**: You acknowledge that these Terms are concluded between you and Recursive Methods Pty Ltd. only, and not with the App Provider. As between us and the App Provider, we are solely responsible for the UpScrolled application and its content. The App Provider has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the UpScrolled application.

(b) **Licence Scope**: The licence granted to you under these Terms is limited to a non-transferable licence to use the UpScrolled application on devices that you own or control and as permitted by the applicable App Provider’s terms of service and usage rules. You may not transfer, redistribute, or sublicense the UpScrolled application. If you sell your device to a third party, you must remove the UpScrolled application before doing so.

(c) **Warranty and Refunds**: In the event of any failure of the UpScrolled application to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify the applicable App Provider, and the App Provider may refund the purchase price (if any) for the application to you in accordance with its terms and policies. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the App Provider will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the application, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be our sole responsibility.

(d) **Product Claims**: The App Provider is not responsible for addressing any claims by you or any third party relating to the UpScrolled application or your possession and/or use of the application, including but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the application fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection, privacy, or similar legislation. Any such claims are our sole responsibility to the extent required by these Terms.

(e) **Intellectual Property Claims**: In the event of any third-party claim that the UpScrolled application or your possession and use of the application infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, we, not the App Provider, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defence, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required by these Terms.

(f) **Third-Party Beneficiary**: The App Provider and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms as they relate to your licence of the UpScrolled application. Upon your acceptance of these Terms, the App Provider will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof.

(g) **Legal Compliance and Export Control**: You represent and warrant that: (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties. You may not use or export the UpScrolled application except as authorized by United States law and the laws of the jurisdiction in which it was obtained.

(h) **Third-Party Terms**: You must comply with all applicable third-party terms of agreement when using the UpScrolled application, including but not limited to your wireless data service agreement and the App Provider’s terms of service.

(i) **Contact Information**: For questions, complaints, or claims with respect to the UpScrolled application, please contact us at: Recursive Methods Pty Ltd., 81-83 Campbell Street, Surry Hills NSW 2010, Australia.

In-App Purchases and Subscriptions
----------------------------------

Some features of the Services, including account verification and premium functionality, are offered through auto-renewable subscriptions or one-time in-app purchases.

(a) **Billing and Payment**: Payments for subscriptions and in-app purchases are processed by the App Provider from which you downloaded the application and are charged to the payment method associated with your app store account at the time of purchase confirmation. We do not have access to or control over your payment information.

(b) **Auto-Renewal**: Subscriptions automatically renew for the same subscription period unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period. The renewal charge will be applied within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period at the rate displayed in the application at the time of renewal.

(c) **Managing and Cancelling Subscriptions**: You may manage or cancel your subscriptions at any time through your account settings in the applicable app store (for example, via your Apple ID Subscriptions settings on iOS devices or your Google Play Subscriptions settings on Android devices). Deleting the application does not cancel an active subscription. It is your responsibility to cancel subscriptions through the appropriate app store interface.

(d) **Pricing and Availability**: Subscription prices, durations, and available plans may vary by country, region, and platform, and are displayed in the application at the time of purchase. Applicable taxes may be added depending on your location and local laws.

(e) **Refunds**: Refunds for purchases made through app stores are handled by the respective App Provider in accordance with their refund policies. We do not directly process or issue refunds for in-app purchases made through third-party app stores. Please contact the App Provider for refund requests.

(f) **Free Trials and Promotions**: If a free trial or promotional period is offered, the subscription will automatically convert to a paid subscription at the end of the trial period unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the trial ends. Any unused portion of a free trial will be forfeited upon purchase of a subscription, where applicable.

(g) **Platform Payment Terms**: Your purchase and use of subscriptions are also subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable App Provider. All payment processing, billing disputes, and subscription management are governed by the App Provider’s terms and policies.

Misuse of the Services
----------------------

You agree not to misuse the Services by interfering with or accessing them using unauthorised methods. You must not circumvent technical limitations in the software provided as part of the Services, nor reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the software unless expressly permitted by applicable law. While accessing or using the Services, you must not engage in any prohibited conduct, such as accessing non-public areas, probing or testing vulnerabilities, accessing or searching the Services through unauthorised means, forging packet headers, engaging in platform manipulation or spamming, or interfering with the access of other users, hosts, or networks. It is also a violation of these Terms to aid or facilitate others in violating them.

Ending These Terms
------------------

You have the option to terminate your legal agreement with us at any time by deactivating your account and discontinuing your use of the Services. Please refer to the [Privacy Policy](https://upscrolled.com/en/privacy-policy/) for details on how your information is handled upon termination.

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account or cease providing you with all or part of the Services if we reasonably believe that you have violated these Terms or our [Rules and Policies](https://upscrolled.com/en/rules-and-policies/), pose a risk to us, engage in unlawful conduct, or exhibit prolonged inactivity. Additionally, if providing the Services to you is no longer commercially viable, we may suspend or terminate your account. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you under these circumstances, either by email or when you attempt to access your account next. However, we may terminate your account for any reason or no reason, to the extent permitted by law. In such cases, the Terms shall terminate, but certain sections, including sections 2, 3, 5, 6, and the misuse provisions of Section 4, shall remain in effect. If you believe your account was terminated in error, please [contact](https://upscrolled.com/en/contact/) us. These Terms survive the deactivation or termination of your account.

5\. Limitations of Liability
----------------------------

By utilising the Services, you acknowledge and agree that the liability of Recursive Methods Pty Ltd., affiliates, related companies, officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, partners, and licensors is subject to the maximum extent permissible in your country of residence.

6\. General
-----------

We reserve the right to revise these Terms periodically. Such changes will not apply retroactively, and the most current version of the Terms, which will always be accessible at [https://upscrolled.com/en/terms-of-service](https://upscrolled.com/en/terms-of-service/), will govern our relationship with you. Except for modifications addressing new features or legal requirements, we will provide you with a 30-day notice prior to implementing changes to these Terms that affect the rights or obligations of any party. This notice may be issued through a service notification or via email to the address associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after such revisions take effect, you agree to be bound by the updated Terms.

To the extent permitted by law, you waive the right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action, collective action, or representative action proceeding.

The UpScrolled User Agreement is drafted in Arabic and English but may be translated into multiple languages in the future. While UpScrolled endeavours to ensure the accuracy of translations, in case of any discrepancies or inconsistencies, the Arabic and English language versions of the UpScrolled User Agreement shall prevail. You acknowledge that English shall serve as the primary reference languages for interpreting and construing the terms of the UpScrolled User Agreement.

### غابرييلا بورد

الشريك المؤسِّس لشركة DNA

بالنسبة لغابرييلا بورد، يبدأ الاتصال الحقيقي بالحقيقة غير المقيّدة. بصفتها الشريكة المؤسسة لشركة [DNA](https://www.dna.online/) — وكالة المحتوى والمنصّة المخصّصة للعلامات التجارية — تساعد الشركات على توسيع منظوماتها الخاصة بالمحتوى. ومع ذلك، فإن رحلتها الريادية، التي شملت تأسيس كل شيء من وكالات محتوى إلى شركة مروحيات، أظهرت لها كيف تعطي المنصات التقليدية الأولوية للربح على حساب الناس. لهذا السبب فهي أيضًا شريك إستراتيجي لأبسكرولد، حيث تسهم في إنشاء فضاءات رقمية تتيح للمجتمعات المهمَّشة مشاركة حقيقتها بلا قيود أو خوف.

وبفضل عملها مع علامات تجارية عالمية، إلى جانب دفاعها عن الحقوق الفلسطينية في الأوساط المهنية، تدرك غابرييلا قوة السرد الأصيل. فهي تدعم روّاد الأعمال والمبدعين والمجتمعات التي ترفض أن يُخرسها التحيّز الخوارزمي أو الرقابة الخفية.
