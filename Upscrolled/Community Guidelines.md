Community Guidelines
--------------------

*   Effective since last update: **\[20/02/2026\]**

At UpScrolled we’re building a space where every voice has equal power — but always within a healthy, respectful, and welcoming environment. Our community thrives on free expression and user choice, yet we draw a clear line where safety, dignity, and trust are concerned. The guidelines below reflect the core principles that keep UpScrolled usable for everyone.

These Community Guidelines (“Guidelines”) govern user conduct on the UpScrolled platform (“UpScrolled,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). These Guidelines apply to all users, creators, contributors, advertisers, and any other individuals or entities accessing or using UpScrolled (collectively, “Users”). By accessing or using UpScrolled, you agree to comply with these Guidelines, our Terms of Service, and our Privacy Policy. UpScrolled reserves the absolute right to remove content, restrict access, suspend features, or terminate accounts that violate these Guidelines, our policies, or applicable law.

PURPOSE
-------

UpScrolled is a platform for user-generated content, social engagement, and creative expression. These Guidelines are designed to promote a safe and respectful environment; prevent harm, abuse, and unlawful conduct; protect user privacy and intellectual property rights; preserve the integrity of the platform; and ensure compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and distribution platform requirements. While UpScrolled supports freedom of expression, such expression must not compromise user safety, legality, or community trust.

GENERAL STANDARDS OF CONDUCT
----------------------------

Users must act lawfully and responsibly; respect the rights, dignity, and safety of others; provide accurate and truthful information; and refrain from conduct that undermines the safety, integrity, or reliability of the platform. Users are solely responsible for the content they create, upload, publish, transmit, stream, or otherwise make available on UpScrolled (“Content”). UpScrolled does not endorse user Content and disclaims liability to the maximum extent permitted by law. We have no tolerance for objectionable content or abusive behavior. Any content or conduct involving hate speech, harassment, sexual exploitation, violence, or threats will be removed, and the responsible accounts may be suspended or permanently banned.

FREE SPEECH PROTECTIONS
-----------------------

UpScrolled recognizes the importance of political discourse, human rights reporting, and journalistic documentation. Content discussing governments, armed conflicts, or political movements will not be removed solely because it is controversial or critical, provided it does not violate these Guidelines. UpScrolled does not engage in viewpoint-based censorship. Enforcement decisions are based on conduct, not political perspective.

HARASSMENT AND ABUSIVE CONDUCT
------------------------------

UpScrolled prohibits harassment, bullying, intimidation, threats, and abusive behavior. Users may not engage in repeated unwanted contact, targeted harassment campaigns, coordinated attacks, or conduct intended to degrade, shame, or silence others. Content that encourages violence, celebrates harm, or incites hostility toward an individual or group is strictly prohibited. We reserve the right to remove abusive Content and take enforcement action, including suspension or permanent termination.

HATE SPEECH AND DISCRIMINATION
------------------------------

UpScrolled does not permit Content that attacks, dehumanizes, threatens, or promotes discrimination against individuals or groups based on protected characteristics, including but not limited to race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, disability, serious medical condition, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, or veteran status. This includes slurs, supremacist ideology, and calls for segregation or exclusion. Violations may result in immediate and permanent removal from the platform.

VIOLENCE AND DANGEROUS ACTIVITIES
---------------------------------

Users may not post Content that threatens or promotes violence; provides instructions for harming others; depicts graphic violence without legitimate context; glorifies extremist or terrorist organizations; or encourages participation in dangerous activities likely to result in serious injury or death.

Users may not organize, coordinate, or disseminate campaigns intended to disrupt elections, civic participation, or democratic processes.

SELF-HARM AND SUICIDE

AUTHENTICITY AND IMPERSONATION
------------------------------

While UpScrolled supports open discussion of developing events, Content that knowingly disseminates demonstrably false information likely to cause imminent harm may be removed.

AI-GENERATED AND SYNTHETIC MEDIA
--------------------------------

AI-generated Content is permitted only if it complies with these Guidelines and applicable law. Users are required to provide a clear disclosure that it was edited or created by artificial intelligence. If a User fails to indicate that the material is AI‑generated, Upscrolled will label the content as such. Users may not use synthetic media to impersonate real individuals without disclosure, fabricate real-world events, or create deceptive deepfakes intended to mislead. UpScrolled reserves the right to remove synthetic media that poses a risk of harm or deception.

PRIVACY AND PERSONAL INFORMATION
--------------------------------

Users may not share private or personally identifiable information about others without consent, including home addresses, personal phone numbers, financial information, government identification numbers, or private communications.

### غابرييلا بورد

الشريك المؤسِّس لشركة DNA

بالنسبة لغابرييلا بورد، يبدأ الاتصال الحقيقي بالحقيقة غير المقيّدة. بصفتها الشريكة المؤسسة لشركة [DNA](https://www.dna.online/) — وكالة المحتوى والمنصّة المخصّصة للعلامات التجارية — تساعد الشركات على توسيع منظوماتها الخاصة بالمحتوى. ومع ذلك، فإن رحلتها الريادية، التي شملت تأسيس كل شيء من وكالات محتوى إلى شركة مروحيات، أظهرت لها كيف تعطي المنصات التقليدية الأولوية للربح على حساب الناس. لهذا السبب فهي أيضًا شريك إستراتيجي لأبسكرولد، حيث تسهم في إنشاء فضاءات رقمية تتيح للمجتمعات المهمَّشة مشاركة حقيقتها بلا قيود أو خوف.

وبفضل عملها مع علامات تجارية عالمية، إلى جانب دفاعها عن الحقوق الفلسطينية في الأوساط المهنية، تدرك غابرييلا قوة السرد الأصيل. فهي تدعم روّاد الأعمال والمبدعين والمجتمعات التي ترفض أن يُخرسها التحيّز الخوارزمي أو الرقابة الخفية.
