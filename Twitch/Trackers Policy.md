#### **What is a Cookie?**

Cookies are small text files that are stored on your devices. When you access a website, a cookie is placed on your device, and it will send information to the party that placed the cookie.

Cookies are widely used in order to make websites and software applications work, or work in a better, more efficient way. They can do this because websites and software applications can read and write these files, enabling them to recognize a particular device and remember important information that will make your use of a website or software application more convenient (e.g., by remembering your user preferences).

Please be aware that if cookies are disabled, not all features of the Twitch Services or Extensions may operate as intended. Some mobile operating systems may further limit the use of cookies and similar technologies; your choices do not override those more limited settings on such mobile devices.
