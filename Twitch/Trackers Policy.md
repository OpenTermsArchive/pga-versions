This Cookie Notice applies to your use of [www.twitch.tv](http://www.twitch.tv/), and any other websites, applications, or services provided by Twitch Interactive, Inc. (with its affiliates, “Twitch”, “we” or “us”) that link to this Cookie Notice (collectively, the “Twitch Services”). Twitch uses certain technologies to collect information through the Twitch Services. In this Cookie Notice, we refer to these technologies, which include HTTP cookies, local storage, pixel tags and web beacons, collectively as “cookies.” This notice explains the different types of cookies used on Twitch Services and how you can control them. We may change this Cookie Notice at any time: please take a look at the “last modified” legend at the top of this page to see when this Cookie Notice was last revised. 

By visiting [www.twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/), setting up your Twitch account, or using the Twitch Services, you are accepting the information handling practices and storage and access of cookies as described in this Cookie Notice.

We hope that this notice helps you understand, and feel more confident about, our use of cookies. If you have any further queries, please contact us at [privacy@twitch.tv](mailto:privacy@twitch.tv).

#### **What is a Cookie?**

Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device. They are widely used in order to make websites and software applications work, or work in a better, more efficient way. They can do this because websites and software applications can read and write these files, enabling them to recognize a particular device and remember important information that will make your use of a website or software application more convenient (e.g., by remembering your user preferences).

#### **What Cookies do we use and why do we use them?**

Below we list the different types of cookies we may use on the Twitch Services.

We use session cookies (that last until you close your browser) and persistent cookies (that last until you delete them from your browser, or until they expire in accordance with their lifespan). Twitch-originated persistent cookies on Twitch Services will have a maximum lifespan of thirteen months from the time you last used the Twitch Services. Cookies used to remember your privacy settings (such as Advertising Preferences), may remain on your browser for up to 5 years.

We use first party and third party cookies. First-party cookies are created and accessed by the host domain - the domain the user is visiting, in this case, Twitch. Third-party cookies are those created and accessed by domains other than the one the user is visiting at the time.
