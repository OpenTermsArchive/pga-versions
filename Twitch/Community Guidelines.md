Community Guidelines
====================

Introduction to Safety on Twitch
================================

Community is the heart of Twitch. From individual communities, built by streamers and their viewers, to the Twitch Community at large, the magic of Twitch comes from enjoying the things we love together. But before you can do what you do best, a very important prerequisite must be met: safety. 

Safety is the foundation beneath streamers, moderators, and everyone in chat. We want to foster a community that supports and sustains streamers’ ability to express themselves, and provides a welcoming and entertaining environment for viewers, free of illegal, harmful, and negative interactions. As a result, we take [an approach to safety](https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Safety-at-Twitch) that combines the efforts of both Twitch and members of the community, working together globally to promote safety in real time. It starts with our Community Guidelines, which seek to balance user expression with community safety, and set expectations for the behavior that everyone on Twitch is expected to demonstrate. When we talk about harm, we mean actions that lead to physical, emotional, social or financial damage or loss to our users or to society. 

These guidelines set the guardrails for what behavior is and is not allowed on our service, and apply to all content on our service, including video, chat, whispers, and accounts. When we find someone has violated our Community Guidelines [we take actions](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/about-account-suspensions-dmca-suspensions-and-chat-bans) that can include removal of content, removal of monetization tools, a warning, and/or suspension of their account. If someone who receives an account enforcement believes it was issued by mistake or in error, they may file an appeal using our [Appeals procedures](https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/appeals).  
  
We consider our Community Guidelines to be a living document, and we work with streamers, mods, and external safety and policy experts to review and update them regularly. In addition to these guidelines, streamers and moderators can also use customizable [Twitch safety tools](https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Chat-Tools) to tailor their channel standards to meet their needs. Viewers, moderators, and streamers play a crucial role by reporting content or behavior that breaks our Community Guidelines. Reports are reviewed by our global Safety Operations team who work 24/7/365 to ensure a swift response. In this way, we all work together to promote a safe and welcoming live environment.

Enforcement Notes
=================

For some of our Community Guidelines below, you will see an “Enforcement Notes and Clarifications” section. Enforcement Notes are additional examples of what is and isn’t allowed on Twitch, focused on clarifying existing policies already being enforced. Enforcement Notes are not new policies or new rules. We write these notes to share more information about our existing Community Guidelines and to answer commonly asked questions.

Safety
======

Self-Destructive Behavior
-------------------------

Harming yourself, or discussing self-harm, can be dangerous for not only yourself but for viewers and those around you. We understand that streamers and viewers should be able to discuss sensitive topics related to self-harm or mental health, and we want Twitch to remain a safe space to do so. Anyone should be able to talk about their struggles, if they so choose**.** However, **Twitch does not allow content that glorifies, promotes, or encourages self-harm. We also prohibit activity that may endanger your life, lead to your physical harm, or encourage others to engage in physically harmful behavior.** We do not make exceptions for self-destructive behavior performed as a stunt or gag made in jest, or meant to entertain, when the behavior could reasonably be expected to cause physical injury to anyone on our service.

[](#)

  For example, you may not show or promote \[content warning\]:

* Glorification and/or promotion of self-harm
* Promotion of eating disorders and sharing of pro-eating disorder content, such as saying you’re “pro-ana”, or sharing your diet plan of not eating for three days and then binge eating on day four
* Sharing graphic details of suicide notes or suicide attempts
* Use of hard drugs and substances not fit for human consumption (e.g., tide pods, bleach)
* Misuse of legal substances (e.g., prescription drugs, whippets)
* Cutting or other forms of self-injury
* Consumption of alcohol or other substances that lead to being incapacitated
* Dangerous or distracted driving, including using a phone while driving and driving under the influence
    

  
If you feel like you’re struggling, or you know someone who you believe might hurt themselves or others, or if someone is at immediate risk of suicide, please contact someone you trust, a healthcare provider, mental health hotline, or local law enforcement for immediate help and support. We also have resources and help lines available for you [here](https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Crisis-Prevention).

  Enforcement Notes and Clarifications:

_Enforcement Notes are additional examples of what is and isn’t allowed on Twitch, focused on clarifying existing policies already being enforced. Updates here do not indicate a change in policy, but are additional examples of existing enforcements._

* Selling activities which may cause harm for monetary gain (such as subscriptions, Bits, tips, etc.) is not allowed. 
    * Prohibited examples: Taking shots of alcohol for subs or doing the “Cinnamon challenge” for a set amount of Bits.
* Drinking goal streams are allowed provided the drinking that takes place is not excessive and would not reasonably be expected to cause harm.
    * Allowed examples:  “I will open this bottle of prosecco at 100 subscribers” or “Drinking stream when we hit 50 new subs tonight” 
    * Prohibited examples: “I will down this bottle of vodka at 300 subscribers” or “I will take a shot for every 100 Bits”
* Dangerous or distracted driving–such as operating your vehicle while interacting with your stream in a way that removes your eyes from the road or hands from controlling your vehicle–is never acceptable on Twitch. 
    * Allowed example: Setting up your streaming device/camera while parked in a safe location prior to driving.
    * Allowed example: Listening to text-to-speech chat messages and responding verbally out loud.
    * Prohibited example: Reading chat messages or physically touching your streaming camera or device for prolonged periods of time or frequency while driving.

Violence and Threats
--------------------

Acts and threats of violence are counterproductive to promoting a safe, inclusive, and friendly community. **Violence on Twitch is taken seriously and is considered a zero-tolerance violation, and all accounts associated with such activities on Twitch will be indefinitely suspended.**

[](#)

  For example, you may not show or promote \[content warning\]:

* Attempts or threats to physically harm or kill others
* Attempts or threats to hack, dox, DDOS, or SWAT others
* Use of weapons to physically threaten, intimidate, harm, or kill others
* Encouraging others to participate in acts that may harm others

In situations where a user has lost control of their broadcast due to severe injury, medical emergency, police action, or being targeted with serious violence, we will temporarily remove the channel and associated content.

In exceptional circumstances, we may preemptively suspend accounts when we believe an individual’s use of Twitch poses a high likelihood of inciting violence. In weighing the risk of harm, we consider an individual’s influence, the level of recklessness in their past behaviors (on Twitch or elsewhere), whether or not there continues to be a risk of harm, and the scale of ongoing threats.

Content or activities that threaten or promote sexual violence are strictly prohibited and may be reported to law enforcement. See [Adult Sexual Violence](https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Community-Guidelines#6AdultSexualViolence) for more detail.

Terrorism and Violent Extremism
-------------------------------

Terrorism and violent extremism promote unlawful violence and spread messages of intolerance. **Twitch does not allow content that depicts, glorifies, encourages, or supports terrorism, or violent extremist actors or acts.** This includes threatening to or encouraging others to commit acts that would result in serious physical harm or significant property destruction. 

[](#)

  For example, you may not \[content warning\]: 

* Display or link terrorist or extremist propaganda, including graphic pictures or footage of terrorist or extremist violence, even for the purposes of denouncing such content

Adult Sexual Violence
---------------------

Acts of sexual violence are a serious offense. Content or activities that promote or threaten sexual violence may be reported to law enforcement. **Sexual violence is not tolerated on Twitch and will result in immediate suspension of your account.** 

[](#)

  For example, you may not show, promote, or engage in \[content warning\]:

* Non-consensual sex acts
* Coercing a guest into committing a sex act by threatening them
* Touching another person in an intimate manner without their consent

Youth Safety
------------

**Twitch prohibits any content or activity that endangers youth. This includes content that features or promotes child sexual abuse material (CSAM), and the sexual exploitation, sexual misconduct or grooming of youth (which is defined by this policy as minors under 18).** We report all illegal content or activity to the [National Center for Missing and Exploited Children](https://www.missingkids.org/HOME), which works with global law enforcement agencies around the world, and the consequence for engaging in such activity or with such content is immediate and indefinite suspension.

[](#)

  For example, you may not show, promote, or engage in \[content warning\]:

* Sexually explicit content or sexualized images of youth
* Sharing links to third-party sites that contain content prohibited by this policy
* Content that promotes, encourages, provides instruction to, or admits participation in the sexual exploitation or sexualization of youth
* Content that constitutes or facilitates inappropriate interactions with youth, including grooming, purposefully exposing youth to sexually explicit language or sexual material, and engaging in sexual conversations in messages with youth
* Content that attempts to exploit youth by coercing money, favors or intimate imagery with threats to expose intimate imagery or information
* Content depicting nudity of youth
* Identifying alleged victims of CSAM by name or image

[](#)

  Enforcement Notes and Clarifications \[content warning\]:

_Enforcement Notes are additional examples of what is and isn’t allowed on Twitch, focused on clarifying existing policies already being enforced. Updates here do not indicate a change in policy, but are additional examples of existing enforcements._

* Depicting fictional anime characters of a child-like appearance (“lolis”/”shotas”) with any kind of sexual framing is not allowed. This applies to VTubers and within games where avatars are uploaded, such as VRChat, with child-like avatars even if the broadcaster and operator of the avatar is above the age of 18. 
* Any humor regarding anything sexual in relation to minors will result in immediate action on your account.
* Stating you are below the age of 13 anywhere on Twitch, even if intended to be humorous, will result in your account being permanently deactivated in accordance with applicable laws.
    * Prohibited examples: Typing in chat “haHAA I’m 12 by the way” or “I’m using my dad’s account because I am 11”.

Off-Service Conduct
-------------------

For streamers and their viewers to build vibrant and dynamic communities, everyone must feel secure and protected. We believe that some off-service offenses committed by Twitch users can create a substantial safety risk to the Twitch community. As a result, **Twitch enforces against certain severe offenses that occur off Twitch when committed by members of the Twitch community.**

[](#)

  For example, we do not allow individuals or organizations who engage off-service in \[content warning\]:

* Deadly violence and violent extremism
* Terrorist activities or recruiting
* Explicit and/or credible threats of mass violence (i.e. threats against a group of people, event, or location where people would gather).
* Leadership, membership, or sponsorship of a known hate group
* Carrying out or deliberately acting as an accomplice to non-consensual sexual activities and/or sexual assault
* Sexual exploitation of youth, such as grooming and/or solicitation/distribution of CSAM
* Actions that would directly and explicitly compromise the physical safety of the Twitch community
* Explicit and/or credible threats against Twitch, including Twitch staff
* Harmful misinformation actors that are persistent misinformation superspreaders
* Doxxing: Sharing personally identifiable information with malicious intent, such as revealing another person’s:
    * Mailing address
    * Home address
    * Work or school addresses 
    * Physical location
    * Sensitive financial information 
    * Government IDs
* Swatting: Deliberately submitting false reports to emergency services to have police break into another person’s address

Users can contact the Twitch [Off-Service Investigations team](mailto:OSIT@twitch.tv) to report cases of any abhorrent and impactful off-service abuses listed above. These reports go directly to our global team responsible for investigating allegations of severe off-service offenses, and are handled with complete confidentiality.  

**Evidence for Off-Service reports**

**Because we have less context for behaviors that occur off Twitch, we require that evidence of these activities is verifiable before we will take action**. This includes content directly uploaded by the violating user or direct reports from victims themselves sent to our Off-Service Investigations team with appropriate evidence. Screenshots and other content from groups not directly involved that may be edited, doctored, or falsified are generally not considered to be sufficient unless they are supported by other verifiable evidence that is accurate and not misrepresented or confirmed by our third party investigator as authentic. Additionally, we will consider law enforcement action(s) as an input when assessing the credibility of accusations and evidence.

[](#)

  **Off-Service FAQ**

**Will on-service reports sent to the Off-Service Investigations Team receive preferential review?**

No.  Please only submit reports that relate to the off-service severe offenses listed above and meet our criteria of having direct and verifiable evidence. This helps our investigations team prioritize and more efficiently action your valid reports, which we know can be particularly urgent given the severe harms they address. **We will not action any report submitted for behavior that is on-service, unrelated to the criteria above, or is not verifiable.**

**Does the victim or accused have to be a Twitch community member?**

No. We believe those who have engaged in the severe offenses listed above are more likely to violate our Community Guidelines on Twitch, or to create overt safety risks for our communities. Therefore, we will apply these standards even if the target of these behaviors is not a Twitch user, or if the party engaging in abuse was not a Twitch user at the time they committed a severe offense. People who engage in these forms of severe abuse off-service are also prohibited from subsequently registering Twitch accounts and attempting to do so will lead to the account’s termination.

**How does Twitch verify off-service behavior?**

Twitch leverages third-party legal experts to assist in investigating severe offenses that occur outside of the Twitch services when needed. 

**What are the limitations of acting on off-service behavior?**

Twitch has established this policy primarily to protect the safety of our users. Because of this, persons who have carried out severe offenses and create a safety risk will be prohibited from using our services. However, in cases where these behaviors have occurred in the distant past, users have gone through a trusted rehabilitation process, such as legally mandated time served in a correctional facility, and our investigative process determines that there is no evidence to suggest that the user would cause any clear and present danger to the community, we may decline to take action against a user or we may unsuspend their account based on an appeal. For particularly egregious offenses that present a physical safety risk to the community, these suspensions will not be eligible for appeal, no matter how much time has elapsed.

Twitch will not actively monitor other websites or services for violations of our Community Guidelines, nor will we be acting on off-Twitch content created prior to March 5, 2018.

**Why is Twitch moderating off-Twitch conduct?**

Community is the heart of Twitch, and our goal is to foster a community where users can bring their authentic selves without fear of harm. We recognize that harm towards Twitch community members can sometimes originate from outside our service. When we are able to verify that harmful behavior occurred off-Twitch and can be attributed to a Twitch account, we believe that it is our responsibility to take action.

**How does off-Twitch conduct influence on-service decisions?**

We recognize that toxicity and abuse can spread to Twitch from outside our services in a way that is detrimental to our community. To mitigate this harm, we will take reported off-service context into account when evaluating violations of any of our Community Guidelines that occur on Twitch. If we are able to verify reports of off-service statements or behaviors that relate to an incident on Twitch, we will use this evidence to support and inform our enforcement decisions. If the off-service behavior does not involve an incident on Twitch, we will not investigate unless it is one of the severe offenses listed above. 

Unauthorized Sharing of Private Information
-------------------------------------------

Sharing someone else’s sensitive data without their permission can be both a distressing and potentially dangerous experience. Therefore, **Twitch doesn’t allow users to reveal personal information of others on our service.**

[](#)

  For example, you may not:

* Share personally identifiable information (PII), such as looking up a streamer’s leaked address and sharing it in chat 
* Share restricted or protected social profiles or any information from those profiles
* Share content that violates another’s reasonable expectation of privacy, for example streaming from a private space, without permission
* Broadcast an unwanted intrusion of private video conference calls
    

[](#)

  Enforcement Notes and Clarifications:

_Enforcement Notes are additional examples of what is and isn’t allowed on Twitch, focused on clarifying existing policies already being enforced. Updates here do not indicate a change in policy, but are additional examples of existing enforcements._

* Requesting or soliciting personally identifiable information that could reasonably be expected to harm a user's safety– physically, financially, or otherwise–if shared is not allowed in chat or on stream.
    * Allowed example: A streamer asking a viewer in chat "What's your first name?" or "What state are you from?" if relevant to conversation.
    * Prohibited example: A streamer asks their chat to "Share your bank details for a giveaway!"

Civility and Respect
====================

Hateful Conduct
---------------

Twitch aims to be a place where everyone can come together in shared, community experiences. This vision is threatened when people experience harmful rhetoric and abuse on Twitch. **Twitch does not permit behavior that is motivated by hatred, prejudice or intolerance, including behavior that promotes or encourages discrimination, denigration, harassment, or violence based on the following protected characteristics: _race, ethnicity, color, caste, national origin, immigration status, religion, sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, serious medical condition,_ and _veteran status_.** We also provide certain protections for _age,_ which are expressly noted in the examples. 

We define 'protected groups' as a subset of the population with a shared protected characteristic. Every Twitch user falls into multiple of these protected groups. Twitch affords every user globally equal protections under this policy.

[](#)

  For example, regardless of your intent, you may not \[content warning\]:

* Promote, glorify, threaten, or advocate violence, physical harm, or death against individual(s) or groups on the basis of a protected characteristic, including age.
    * Incite or promote violence against a protected group, e.g., “kill all the \[protected group\]”
    * Promote or express a desire for a protected group to be infected and/or die from a serious disease
    * Tell a user to kill themselves used in combination with a hateful slur, e.g., “kys \[slur\]”
    * Modify video game content to promote violence against a group based on a protected characteristic
    * Glorify specific hate crimes or mass violent acts and/or the perpetrators of such acts
    * Suggest that a victim of a hate crime deserved to be harmed
* Use hateful slurs, either untargeted or directed towards another individual. We allow certain words or terms, which might otherwise violate our policy, to be used in an empowering way or as terms of endearment when such intent is clear. We also make exceptions for slurs in music—and singing along to music—as long as the song itself is not hateful and the slurs are not combined with other discriminating or denigrating content. 
    * Enter a chat and spamming a slur
    * Target an individual with a slur based on a protected characteristic in chat
    * Include a slur in profile content
    * Call another player a slur while streaming
* Post, upload, or otherwise share hateful images or symbols, including symbols of established hate groups and Nazi-related imagery.
    * Stream with a Confederate flag in the background. Given its historic association with slavery and white supremacist groups in the US, displaying this symbol— in non-educational contexts — runs counter to Twitch’s commitment to being a service that is inclusive and welcoming to all users.
    * Wear a T-shirt with the Arrow Cross
    * Post a swastika or SS bolts in chat
* Create speech, imagery, or emote combinations that dehumanize or perpetuate negative stereotypes and/or memes.
    * Black/brown/yellow/redface
    * Content that perpetuates a recognized negative stereotype about a protected group as greedy or unintelligent
    * Content perpetuating negative associations between an animal and a protected group, or comparing a protected group to animals that are perceived as inferior or unclean
    * Content comparing a protected group to insects, pests, parasites, filth, or diseases/viruses
    * Content suggesting that protected group members are sub-human, inhuman, or impure
    * Content insinuating that individuals with certain protected characteristics are criminals or terrorists
    * Referring to a protected group as property or things
    * Intentionally referring to someone using a pronoun or form of address that does not correctly reflect the gender with which they identify, such as repeating incorrect pronouns after being asked to stop
* Create content that expresses inferiority based on a protected characteristic, for example, statements related to physical, mental, and moral deficiencies. 
    * Support for or promotion of outdated, discriminatory genetic or anthropological theories, including eugenics
    * Claims of divine sanction for hostility toward a protected group 
    * Negative statements related to mental health, e.g., “\[protected characteristic\] is a form of insanity” 
    * Negative statements related to hygiene, e.g., “\[protected group\] are all smelly”
    * Expressions questioning a group’s worth, e.g., “\[protected group\] are useless”
    * Statements suggesting inferiority of a protected group, e.g., “\[protected group\] are just worse at gaming”
    * Statements questioning the moral integrity of a protected group, including statements suggesting that a protected group are all cheaters
    * Content that implies that another contemporary culture is primitive 
* Call for subjugation, segregation or exclusion, including political, economic, and social exclusion/segregation, based on a protected characteristic, including age. We do, however, allow discussions on certain topics such as immigration policy, voting rights for non-citizens, and professional sports participation as long as the content is not directly denigrating based on a protected characteristic.
    * Support for denying right to political participation, e.g., “\[protected group\] should not be allowed to vote”
    * Support for limiting participation in the workplace, e.g., “we shouldn’t hire \[protected group\]”
    * Calls for exclusion from public services, e.g., “we shouldn’t spend tax dollars educating \[protected group\]”
    * Calls for exclusion from online services based on protected characteristic, including suggestions that a protected group does not belong on Twitch
    * Calls for controlling or dominating a group of people, including glorifying a period because a protected group was subjugated during that time, e.g., “slavery was the glory days of America”
* Encourage or support the political or economic dominance of any race, ethnicity, or religious group, including support for white supremacist/nationalist ideologies. This does not include support for self-determination movements.
    * Support for the hegemony of any group based on protected characteristic
    * Calls to increase fertility rates or restrict immigration to preserve the economic/political/social power of any group 
* Expressions of contempt, hatred, or disgust based on a protected characteristic.
    * Statements that a protected group should not exist
    * Statements dismissing an entire group, e.g., “I don’t like \[protected group\]”
    * Statements that a protected characteristic is repulsive or disgusting, or causes sickness, e.g., “\[protected group\] just make me want to vomit”
* Mock the event/victims or deny the occurrence of well-documented hate crimes, or deny the existence of documented acts of mass murder/genocide against a protected group.
    * Drawing a cartoon mocking the victim of a hate crime
    * Denial of the existence of a genocide, including the Holocaust
    * Suggesting a documented act of mass murder motivated by a protected characteristic was a hoax
* Make unfounded claims assigning blame to a protected group, or that otherwise intends to incite fear about a protected group as it relates to health and safety.
    * Conspiracy theories that individuals or groups are evil, corrupt or malicious based on a protected characteristic
    * Claims that a protected group created or is intentionally spreading a disease
    * Statements suggesting that a protected characteristic makes an individual more likely to be a criminal and/or terrorist
* Encourage the use of or generally endorsing sexual orientation conversion therapy.
* Support, promote, or be a member of a hate group, including sharing hate group propaganda materials.
* Create accounts dedicated to hate, such as through abusive usernames.

[](#)

  Enforcement Notes and Clarifications \[content warning\]:

_Enforcement Notes are additional examples of what is and isn’t allowed on Twitch, focused on clarifying existing policies already being enforced. Updates here do not indicate a change in policy, but are additional examples of existing enforcements._

* We take into consideration if the reported user belongs to the targeted protected group to help determine if an offense occurred.
    * We consider context when enforcing. Self-deprecating terminology in a positive or joking way may be treated differently than terminology targeted at someone else.
    * The “N-word” with a “hard R”, a racial slur, is never allowed under any circumstances.
* Denouncing slurs in context is allowed.
    * Allowed examples: Speaking of an experience where a slur was used against yourself or which you overheard - “I was at the supermarket and heard someone yell \[slur\]” or “I was once called a \[slur\] at work by a colleague”.
* We prohibit the use of terms that may not be harmful or abusive in isolation, but can be used as a slur or to denigrate others in certain contexts. Similar to other terms that may be used as a proxy for a protected group, we treat “Zionists” as a proxy for Jews or Israelis if the word is used in a context to promote harm or violence, or when used to make dehumanizing comparisons or perpetuate antisemitic stereotypes. Comments regarding Zionism that are about the political movement, including criticisms, do not violate our Hateful Conduct Policy. Comments that call for violence against Zionism as a political movement, or comments that would otherwise violate our policies, are not allowed.
    
    * Allowed example: Zionist settlers keep encroaching Palestinian borders.
    * Prohibited example: Zionist \[name of animal\].

Harassment
----------

Harassment deters the growth of vibrant and diverse communities, prevents people from feeling safe on Twitch, and creates a gateway for more severe forms of harm and abuse. People experience harassment in different ways, including personal attacks, promotion of physical harm, and malicious brigading. **Engaging in harassment will result in enforcement action taken against the relevant accounts.**

Please keep in mind, we expect streamers to take the necessary steps to mitigate harassing content that appears on their stream or in their chat. We will not suspend broadcasters that we find to be acting in good-faith (including by using tools such as AutoMod, timeouts, and channel bans) to remove abuse appearing from third parties and external sources.

[](#)

  For example, you may not engage in \[content warning\]:

* Wishing harm or death on others
    * Telling another person to severely harm or kill themselves
    * Saying that another person deserves to contract a terminal or severe illness
* Glorifying, endorsing, or expressing approval of a person’s past or current traumatic events
    * Telling a victim of a violent crime or their kin that they deserved to be harmed (if based on a protected characteristic, this is evaluated under Hateful Conduct)
    * Encouraging a suicidal person to kill themselves
* Making implied physical threats to others (Note that explicit threats of violence are handled under our Violence and Threats policy)
* Targeting others with repeated or severe personal attacks
    * Repeatedly sending personal insults to a broadcaster after being timed-out in the channel
    * Browsing other broadcasters’ channels on stream and directing insults towards them related to their intelligence or appearance
* Sharing negative doctored or artistic content to abuse or degrade another person
    * Creating “deepfake” videos to insult or abuse another person
    * Drawing images of another person for the purposes of mocking or attacking that person
* Inciting viewers to target another person with abuse, regardless of whether the targets are on or off-Twitch
    * Organizing or participating in hostile raiding
    * Directly opening a user’s channel on stream and directing personal attacks towards them
* Making malicious contact towards legitimate businesses or private persons
    * Calling customer support lines repeatedly and hanging up, or calling restaurants and placing fake orders
* Deliberate, non-consensual in-game stream sniping, including using another person’s stream to gain a competitive advantage in a multiplayer game and disrupt their broadcast
* Stalking or ignoring another person’s established personal physical boundaries
    * Broadcasting another person who has denied consent
    * Broadcasting in a location where recording is prohibited
* Creating accounts dedicated to harassment, such as through abusive usernames

Streamers should always consider the consequences of their statements and actions of their audiences; sometimes unwanted focus or attention can encourage others to escalate their behavior into abuse. For example, broadcasting other Twitch streams while insulting those users often encourages others to also direct abuse to the target. Participating in this activity can, therefore, lead to suspension of your account.  

Although harassment is never allowed on Twitch, we want users to express themselves naturally with their friends and communities without fear that these interactions could be misidentified as harassment. In order to fully understand the context of incidents that appear unclear when viewed in isolation, we may require that individuals who feel targeted by abuse indicate that these actions were not consensual banter before we will intervene. Filing a user report or taking moderation action on the individual’s channel count as such indications.

Sexual Harassment
-----------------

Twitch firmly opposes sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is never acceptable, whether these comments are directed towards others on or off Twitch. We define sexual harassment to encompass non-physical behaviors of a sexual nature that cause users to feel uncomfortable, degraded, unsafe, or discouraged from participation. **We prohibit unwanted comments–including comments made using emojis/emotes–regarding someone's appearance or body, sexual requests or advances, sexual objectification, and negative statements or attacks related to a person's perceived sexual behaviors or activities, regardless of their gender. We also do not tolerate the recording or sharing of non-consensual intimate images or videos under any circumstances, and may report such content to law** **enforcement.**

[](#)

  For example, the following categories of behaviors are considered to be sexual harassment, and are prohibited on Twitch \[content warning\]:

* Making unwanted sexual advances towards another person
    * Whispering another user with compliments about their appearance after being asked to stop  
    * Sending chat messages to another user and calling them “sexy” after previously being timed-out for similar behavior
    * Asking another user to expose their non-sexual body parts, such as their feet, after receiving a chat warning
    * Persisting in asking about someone’s sexual experiences or history after being informed it’s unwanted
    * Sending nude pictures or videos to another person
    * Directing others to sexually explicit content
* Making unsolicited objectifying statements relating to the sexual body parts or practices of another person
    * Making sexually-focused comments about another person’s breasts, buttocks, or genitals
    * Commenting on another person’s perceived sexual abilities or lack thereof
    * Commenting on how sexually aroused they are based on another person’s features
* Making requests for sexual favors or making unsolicited statements in reference to performing graphic sexual acts on another person
    * Asking a streamer to expose themselves or send nude images
    * Whispering other users and asking them to perform graphic sex acts
    * Discussing a desire to perform graphic sex acts on a public figure
* Making derogatory statements about another person’s perceived sexual practices, sexual morality, or sexual health
    * Alleging that a person is sexually immoral due to their attire or physical appearance
    * Stating that a person’s attire reflects negatively on their sexual practices
    * Suggesting that a person’s channel is only popular or has not been suspended due to sexual favors
    * Repeatedly negatively targeting another person with sexually-focused terms, such as ‘whore’ or ‘virgin’
    * Making claims that another person likely has a sexually transmitted infection due to their sexual practices
* Attempting to coerce others into providing sexual content or favors through threats, bribes or other inducements
    * Offering to promote a user’s channel in exchange for sexual acts
    * Threatening retribution against another person if they do not share sexual images or videos
* Advocating for or expressing a desire to commit sexual violence against another person
    * Expressing a wish for another person to experience sexual assault
    * Directing another person to carry out non-consensual sexual acts
    * Discussing a desire to commit rape against another person 
* Sharing or threatening to share non-consensual intimate images or videos
    * Deliberately recording sexual body parts or intimate activities of another person without their awareness or consent
    * Offering a private video of another person having sex, without permission of the person depicted
    * Sharing leaked nude images of another person without their consent
    * Creating or sharing doctored or ‘deepfake’ intimate images of an identifiable person

When applicable, we will take indications (i.e., timeouts, channel bans, user reports, etc.) from the individual(s) targeted by this behavior into account to help us understand when advances and other statements are unwanted, even if they are not clearly derogatory. If you encounter sexual harassment, we encourage you to submit a report to us and use the moderation tools available to indicate that the behavior is unwanted as this helps us understand that you feel harassed.

Streamers are leaders of the communities they create or foster around them. Streamers should always consider the consequences of their statements and actions of their audiences; sometimes unwanted focus or attention can encourage others to escalate their behavior into abuse. For example, broadcasting other Twitch streams while insulting these users often encourages others to also direct abuse to the target. Participating in this activity can, therefore, lead to suspension of your account. 

We expect streamers to take the necessary steps to mitigate harassing content that appears on their stream. We will not suspend streamers that we find to be acting in good-faith (including by using tools such as AutoMod, timeouts, and channel bans) to remove abuse appearing from third parties and external sources.

  Civility and Respect FAQ
-----------------------------------

**What is the line between hateful conduct and harassment?**

Harassment becomes hateful conduct when the behavior is targeted at an individual(s) on the basis of protected characteristic(s). As Twitch does not tolerate any abuse that is motivated by hatred, prejudice or intolerance, the penalty for such behavior is more severe. Instances of Hateful Conduct will always lead to enforcement action, even if the report is submitted by a 3rd-party that wasn’t targeted by this behavior.

**Am I required to communicate to another user that I feel harassed by their behavior in order for my report to be considered valid?**

No, you may decide that some forms of harassment are severe enough to warrant reporting without first communicating to the other user that they are unwanted. You may choose to communicate that this conduct is unwanted, but we strongly recommend that you do so only if you feel that it is safe and appropriate. If the unwanted behavior persists, we recommend you report the user and consider other options to manage the situation such as blocking the user’s account(s) or banning them from chat. For more information on managing abuse directed towards you, see our guide on [How to Manage Harassment in Chat](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/how-to-manage-harassment-in-chat). 

**How can I indicate that a behavior is unwanted?**

We take context into account when determining whether a violation of our policies has occurred, and this extends to determining whether a behavior against another user is unwanted. You can indicate to others that a behavior is unwanted in several ways, including issuing a channel moderation action (e.g., you or your mod issue a timeout, channel ban, or message deletion) against the individual, or otherwise clearly denouncing the behavior. In addition to reports submitted directly by the target of a behavior, Twitch will also take these indications into account when evaluating reports of harassment and sexual harassment.

**I enjoy friendly banter and trash talk. How can I make it clear that I don’t intend to harass anyone?**

Be cognizant of others—some people only recognize or enjoy banter when they have an established relationship with the other person. If someone asks you to stop or indicates that your conduct is unwanted, such as through a channel timeout, continuing to target them after that point will be seen as a deliberate attempt to harass. If a discussion becomes heated and goes beyond friendly banter, consider removing yourself from the conversation to prevent the situation from escalating further. Additionally, some topics are generally not viewed as acceptable banter by the community, such as sending sexual solicitations or encouraging others to harm themselves. You should not engage in these behaviors, and doing so will jeopardize your Twitch account. 

**Can I be suspended for sexually suggestive conversations even if I do not intend to harass anyone?**

Our guidelines on sexual harassment do not apply in conversations where there is clear, mutual consent. However, even if both parties clearly have an established relationship, we will issue an enforcement if we obtain any indication from the target that sexually harassing statements made on Twitch are unwanted, or if mutual consent is not explicitly clear. A person’s physical appearance or attire is not an indication of solicitation or consent. Additionally, please note that sexual commentary that is graphic or extended, even if not in violation of our sexual harassment policy, is still subject to our sexual content policy.

**Can I be suspended for hateful or harassing content that viewers put on my stream?**

You are responsible for ensuring that content that appears on your stream abides by our Terms of Service and Community Guidelines. If harassing or hateful content does appear on your stream, we expect that you take the necessary steps to mitigate this behavior and keep it from happening again. We will not suspend broadcasters that we find to be acting in good-faith to remove abuse appearing from third parties and external sources, such as by using AutoMod, timeouts, and channel bans. Conversely, we encourage you to report users who attempt to put hateful or harassing content on your channel, as this will lead to a suspension of their Twitch account(s).

**Are streamers responsible for all hateful content in their channel?** 

Streamers are role models and leaders of the communities they create or foster around them. Streamers are expected to use channel moderators and the [tools](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/setting-up-moderation-for-your-twitch-channel) we provide, such as [AutoMod](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/how-to-use-automod) , chat timeouts and bans, to mitigate hateful conduct in their channel. Not using the provided tools to moderate hateful conduct appearing on a channel—or otherwise attempting to mitigate the behavior/content—will lead to a suspension. 

**What slurs are considered violating?**

We do not make our list of prohibited slurs public so as not to enable or facilitate evasion of this policy. We take context into account when evaluating whether use of a slur violates our policies.

**How does Twitch handle humor and satire?**

We do not tolerate hateful or harassing behavior, or conduct that encourages or incites hate or harassment in any way. However, we allow users to discuss content that is hateful or harassing for the purposes of satire or education, as long as this context is clear. Satirical content is acceptable if it uses elements such as irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and critique abusive behaviors. Attempting to promote hateful viewpoints under the guise of education or comedy will lead to suspension of your account. Additionally, exceptions to these standards are made when sharing content from rated movies/TV or developer-generated content in non-prohibited video games in a way that is not directly discriminating or denigrating. 

**Are all hateful violations treated equally?**

We will take action on all instances of hateful conduct and harassment, with an increasing severity of enforcement when the behavior is targeted, personal, graphic, or repeated/prolonged, incites further abuse, or involves threats of violence or coercion. The most egregious violations may result in an indefinite suspension on the first offense. 

**How should I handle cases of potential criminal misconduct?**

We encourage users to submit reports against harassment or hateful conduct directed towards themselves. If you feel that this abuse rises to a legal claim or to a crime, however, we encourage you to also seek help from an attorney or your local law enforcement. If someone else’s behavior has made you fear for your own safety or that of your immediate family, we encourage you to report this to your local law enforcement immediately. When contacted by law enforcement through the appropriate legal process, Twitch will provide the relevant information, as laid out in our [Terms of Service](https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/terms-of-service/). 

Illegal Activity
================

Breaking the Law
----------------

For the safety of our community, **we require users to respect all applicable local, national, and international laws while using our services**. Any content or activity featuring, encouraging, offering, or soliciting illegal activity is prohibited and may be reported to law enforcement.

[](#)

  For example, you may not \[content warning\]:

* Engage in any form of human trafficking, including sex trafficking, sales of children, forced marriages, or domestic servitude
* Buy or sell illegal drugs, firearms, or counterfeit goods on Twitch
* Commit or aid in the destruction, defacement, or theft of public or another person’s property without permission on Twitch

Intellectual Property Rights
----------------------------

In order to protect the intellectual property rights of others and comply with intellectual property laws, **we do not allow users to share content on their Twitch channel that they do not own or otherwise have rights to share**. 

[](#)

  For example, without permission from the rights holders or unless otherwise permitted by law, you may not share:

* Performing other people’s copyrighted content, including playing another artist’s copyrighted songs 
* Other Twitch creators’ content or content from other sites
* Pirated games or content from unauthorized private servers
* Movies, television shows, or sports matches
* Music you do not own or do not have the rights to share, including music streamed in the background of a user’s broadcast
* Goods or services protected by trademark
* Closed Alphas/Betas and Pre-Release Games. We ask that you respect all publisher/developer-enforced release dates, embargoes, and NDAs by waiting to broadcast these games until everyone else gets to. Unless given prior approval, your channel may be subject to DMCA takedown by a rights holder. 

[Learn more](https://legal.twitch.com/legal/music/) about our policies regarding including music in your Twitch channel.

[](#)

  Any unauthorized content users share on Twitch violates our Terms of Service and is subject to removal. Multiple violations of our policies may lead to a permanent suspension of a user’s account. Rights holders may request that Twitch remove unauthorized content and/or issue penalties through the following processes:

* For copyrighted works, the notice-and-takedown process described in our [DMCA Guidelines](https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/dmca-guidelines/).
* For trademarks, the process described in our [Trademark Policy](https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/trademark-policy/).
* For copyrighted works owned by rights holders with whom Twitch has contractual arrangements, we may have separate reporting and handling processes, for example, the [Music Reporting Process](https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/legal/dmca-guidelines/music-reporting-process).

Sensitive Content
=================

Extreme Violence, Gore, and Other Obscene Conduct
-------------------------------------------------

Although we allow a variety of content to be shown on Twitch, content that features extreme violence or gore may be disturbing and distressing, especially if there is death, mutilation, or blood. **Content that exclusively focuses on extreme or gratuitous gore and violence is prohibited.** Additionally, websites that heavily feature adult content such as sexually explicit content, illegal content, or death and gore are prohibited. 

[](#)

  For example, you may not \[content warning\]:

* Show content with death or extreme injury
* Browse 4chan, the dark web, or porn on Twitch
* Use randomized video chat services

[](#)

  Enforcement Notes and Clarifications:

_Enforcement Notes are additional examples of what is and isn’t allowed on Twitch, focused on clarifying existing policies already being enforced. Updates here do not indicate a change in policy, but are additional examples of existing enforcements._

* Randomized video content that you can not control is never allowed under any circumstances due to the risks it poses to viewers of the stream.
    * Prohibited example: streaming Ome.tv interactions.

Sexual Content
--------------

To ensure content on Twitch is appropriate for diverse audiences, certain sexual content is prohibited, regardless of the medium used to create it (digital or non-digital). Users are **prohibited from broadcasting, uploading, soliciting, promoting, offering, and linking to pornographic content**.

[](#)

  For example, you may not show, offer, or promote \[content warning\]:

* Explicit, simulated, fictional, or implied sex or masturbation. This includes oral, anal, and vaginal sex, touching of genitals in self or mutual masturbation, or prolonged audio that implies sex/masturbation/orgasm.
    * Adult nudity without implied or real sex acts is subject to our [Adult Nudity](https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Community-Guidelines#21AdultNudity) policies 
* Display of sexual bodily fluids
* Advertisement or solicitation of sexual services, including prostitution, escort services, sexual massages, and filmed sexual activity
* Content that focuses on clothed intimate body parts such as the buttocks, groin, or breasts for extended periods of time.
    
* Consensual sexual violence such as flogging or whipping another person
    * Non-consensual sexual violence is subject to our [Adult Sexual Violence and Exploitation](https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Community-Guidelines?#6AdultSexualViolenceandExploitation) policies 
* Graphic descriptions of sex acts such as phone sex or erotica
* Display of sex toys in a non-educational context, such as bragging about the size of a dildo

The foregoing list is not exhaustive, and Twitch reserves the right to remove content that it deems to be inappropriate.  
  
Users may not directly link, promote, or advertise pornographic content in their broadcasts, profile, or chat. While users may not directly link to pornographic or sexually explicit content in their broadcasts, profile, or chat, users will not be penalized for linking to their personal websites or social media pages that may incidentally contain these links.  
  
For information about content relating to sexuality and sexual themes that is allowed with a label, see the [Sexual Themes policy](https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Content-Classification-Guidelines#2II:SexualThemes).

[](#)

  Enforcement Notes and Clarifications \[content warning\]:

_Enforcement Notes are additional examples of what is and isn’t allowed on Twitch, focused on clarifying existing policies already being enforced. Updates here do not indicate a change in policy, but are additional examples of existing enforcements._

* Direct links to websites that primarily provide sexual content are not allowed in your content (overlay, bio, sent in chat, etc).
    * If any links to this kind of content through methods such as link aggregators are found, Twitch may apply the Sexual Themes Content Classification Label for a set amount of time.
* We allow certain content that includes sexual themes, providing it is educational in nature, has relevant Content Classification Labels applied to the stream, and doesn’t break our other guidelines such as Nudity. 
    * Allowed example: You may have content which showcases how to apply a condom on a banana providing the intent is to educate.
* Positioning your camera to highlight intimate body areas is not allowed.
    * Prohibited example: Stretching your legs apart in view of the camera for extended periods of time.
* Artistic depictions of nudity are only allowed in the context of public art. 
    * Allowed examples: Showing a nude statue in a city square, or streaming from a museum or an art history lecture.
* If prohibited sexual content is shared accidentally, your account will still be suspended. If you are unsure if a link, photo, video, or other content in your broadcast abides by the Community Guidelines, we suggest that you review it privately before airing it on your broadcast.
* If your channel is reported multiple times in a short period of time for sexual content (or for any other policy violation), this will not result in your channel being suspended if you did nothing wrong. All of our sexual content enforcements are manually reviewed and issued.
* Emotes, badges, and cheermotes are also subject to our policies. Because subscriber emotes are available for use globally across Twitch and highly visible outside of their original channels, our emote guidelines may be more restrictive than our general Community Guidelines in some instances. Please refer to the [Emote Guidelines](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/emote-guidelines) to review emote-specific standards for sexual content. 
* Games featuring nudity, pornography, sex, or sexual violence as a core focus or feature are entirely prohibited. Custom gameplay or visual modifications that include nudity or sex content, including uncensored patches, in otherwise allowed games are prohibited.
* For games where nudity is not the core focus or feature, the Mature-rated Games Content Classification Label is sufficient for incidental nudity. However, the Sexual Themes Content Classification Label must be applied to gameplay that includes nudity but is not the main focus of the game.
    * Allowed example: Streaming Grand Theft Auto V with the Mature-rated Games Content Classification Label.
* Users may not engage in simulated sexual activity or erotic roleplay with other players in online games. Games that primarily consist of user-generated content, in-game roleplay, or interactions in virtual reality are not exempt from this policy.
    * Prohibited example: Simulating sexual activity on VRChat.
* As long as attire requirements are met, body painting on the breasts and buttocks is allowed with a Sexual Themes Content Classification Label. 

Adult Nudity
------------

**Users are prohibited from broadcasting or uploading content that contains depictions of** **real or fictional nudity**, regardless of the medium used to create it**.** Incomplete censoring, such as pixelization, mosaics, blurring effects, sheer or partially see-through clothing do not constitute an exemption to this policy. 

[](#)

  For example, you may not show or promote \[content warning\]:

* Exposed anuses or fully unclothed and exposed buttocks
* Any amount of exposed genitals
* Female presenting individuals’ breasts with exposed nipples (unless actively breastfeeding a child)

Art history educational content or public art that might feature nude figures are exempt from this policy. 

Attire
------

In order to set consistent standards that allow creators to express themselves without exposing our community to inappropriate content, **we have an attire policy, with detailed examples below**. We aim to be transparent around our standards and expectations to empower creative expression and boost creators’ confidence with a clear understanding of our guidelines. 

The list of contextual exceptions, outlined below, is not exhaustive. If you find yourself in a situation that is not described by an exception, then we expect you to follow the standard guidelines.

[](#)

  ****Standard guidelines**** 

We don’t permit streamers, their co-hosts, or their invited guests to be fully or partially nude, including exposing genitals or buttocks. Nor do we permit streamers to imply or suggest that they are fully or partially nude, including, but not limited to, covering breasts or genitals with objects or censor bars. We do not permit the visible outline of genitals, even when covered. Broadcasting nude or partially nude minors is always prohibited, regardless of context.

For those who present as women, we ask that you cover your nipples and areolas and do not expose underbust. Cleavage is unrestricted as long as these coverage requirements are met and it is clear that the streamer is wearing clothing. 

For all streamers, you must cover the area extending from your hips to the bottom of your pelvis and buttocks. 

For those areas of the body where coverage is required, the coverage must be fully opaque; sheer or partially see-through clothing does not constitute coverage.

[](#)

  ****Contextual exceptions****

**IRL streaming**

Streamers, their co-hosts, and invited guests engaging in general IRL streaming outside the home must follow standard body-coverage expectations. Those passing through the background of your stream are not held to the standard dress code requirement and the content does not have to be placed in the Pools, Hot Tubs, and Beaches category, but broadcasting nudity is not permitted regardless of context. If accidental nudity appears on your stream, we expect you to take immediate action, remove the content, and take precautionary steps so it won’t happen again. You should not focus your stream on anyone violating our clothing or sexual content standards; you will be held accountable for doing so to the same extent as if you were violating the standards yourself. 

**Swim and beaches, concerts and festivals**

Swimwear, short shorts, and bodysuits are permitted as long as they completely cover the genitals, and those who present as women must also cover their nipples and areolas. Full coverage of buttocks is not required, but camera focus around them is still subject to our Sexual Content policy. Coverage must be fully opaque, even when wet. Sheer or partially see-through swimwear or other clothing does not constitute coverage.  
  
Content subject to this contextual exception must be placed within the Pools, Hot Tubs, and Beaches category. Content that violates standard attire guidelines and is not subject to this contextual exception (e.g. wearing a bikini outside of pool or beach setting) is still violative even if placed into the Pools, Hot Tubs, and Beaches category.

**Body Art**

For streams dedicated to body art, full chest coverage is not required, but those who present as women must completely cover their nipples & areola with a layer of non-transparent clothing or a paint & latex combination (artist-grade pasties, tape, latex or similar alternatives are acceptable). This coverage must be applied before streaming begins, not on-stream. Buttocks and genitals must also be fully covered by opaque attire. In addition, we ask that streamers add a Sexual Themes Content Classification Label when painting on their chests or buttocks.  
  
This exception to the general coverage requirements only applies while the streamer is actively engaged in body painting, though the streamer may take short breaks between active painting sessions, or when painting is complete to model the results.

**Context transitions**

Streamers are given some leeway for making transitions between contexts with different limits of acceptable attire (e.g., beach to general outdoor IRL streaming). In these situations, streamers are expected to only spend as much time wearing insufficient attire as needed to add clothing or change offscreen into clothing with appropriate coverage for the new context.

**Additional exceptions**

The standard chest coverage requirements outlined above do not apply to individuals actively breastfeeding a child on stream. 

[](#)

  Enforcement Notes and Clarifications \[content warning\]:

_Enforcement Notes are additional examples of what is and isn’t allowed on Twitch, focused on clarifying existing policies already being enforced. Updates here do not indicate a change in policy, but are additional examples of existing enforcements._

* When evaluating reports for sexual conduct, attire is just one factor we will use in making a determination on whether conduct is acceptable.
    * We recommend streamers wear attire that would be publicly appropriate for the context, location, and activity they are broadcasting. For example, workout clothes would be appropriate for a fitness stream and a swimsuit would be appropriate for a stream from a public beach.
* The attire policy applies to VTubers, in the same way it applies to other streamers.
* Genitalia, buttocks, hips, female-presented nipples, and underbust must be covered at all times on general streams. These guidelines apply to Vtuber models but not video game characters including those uploaded into games such as VRChat.
    * Hip coverage is often forgotten in this rule, please be sure that your Vtuber model covers this area.
* Festival and beach wear allows slightly more revealing clothing when within the relevant category - allowing the showing of hips and underbust, but genitalia and female-presenting nipples must still be covered.
* Static or slightly animated artwork for scenes such as “Stream Starting”, “Be Right Back” and “Stream Ending” artwork must follow all of our guidelines.
* If you are in a “setting” such as a Pool, Hot Tub, or Beach (that may not be real) props do not require water within them for us to still consider you in the correct context.
    * Your content is still required to be in the correct category and apply any applicable Content Classification Labels.
* If we cannot functionally tell whether or not you are clothed, or you are implying you are not clothed, through methods such as tight skin-toned clothing, black bars, blurring, hiding behind props or being off-screen, you will be at risk of enforcement for our Attire and possibly our Sexual Content Policies. 

Account Usernames and Display Names
-----------------------------------

In order to ensure that our community is safe and inclusive, **inappropriate account names that violate our Community Guidelines are prohibited**. We also recognize that an account’s username has more impact across our services than many other forms of content because they are persistent, cross-functional, and, in most cases, much more visible. Because of this, we have additional, higher standards for usernames based on reducing harm across our services.

[](#)

   For example, usernames and display names created on Twitch may not include \[content warning\]:

* Breaking the law, including terrorism and child exploitation
* Violence and threats
* Hateful conduct
* Harassment and sexual harassment
* Unauthorized sharing of private information
* Impersonation
* Glorification of natural or violent tragedies
* Self-destructive behavior
* References to recreational drugs, hard drugs, and drug abuse, with exceptions for alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana
* References to sexual acts, genital, or sexual fluids

[](#)

  Indefinite suspensions are issued for usernames and display names that constitute clear violations of our standard Community Guidelines, or that are typically representative of malicious and bad-faith behavior. For example, you may not create a username that includes \[content warning\]:

* References to terrorism or terrorist organizations
* References to child grooming or exploitation
* Threats, promotions, or calls to real-life violence against others (with exceptions for references to video game or non-hateful historical violence)
    * Calling for another group of people to be harmed or killed
    * Creating a username that threatens violence against another person
* Hateful Conduct, including slurs and derogatory terminology related to protected characteristics
    * Creating a username that includes a hateful slur
    * Glorifying, promoting, or advocating for discrimination, denigration, segregation, exclusion, hatred, or disgust based on protected characteristics (see our Hateful Conduct policy for more information)
    * Creating a username that references a hate group
    * Mocking, denying, or glorifying the occurrence of well-documented hate crimes or acts of genocide
* Harassment and Sexual Harassment directed towards another person
    * Creating a username that is sexually degrading towards another person
    * Creating a username that includes insults targeted towards another person’s sexual practices
    * Creating a username that includes a personal attack or targeted profanity against another person
    * Directing an insulting username towards another person
    * Mocking streamers, community members, or their friends and family that have passed away
* Threats or promotion of suicide and self-harm
    * Glorifying methods of self-harm, including suicide and eating disorders
    * Encouraging another person to self-harm or commit suicide
    * Registering a username that threatens suicidal action
* Personal information of another person leaked without consent
    * IP addresses, email addresses
    * Mailing addresses, home addresses, private work or school addresses
    * Personal or private phone numbers
    * Sensitive identification or financial information, such as bank account numbers or government ID numbers
* Impersonation of another person, company, or organization
    * Attempting to misrepresent yourself as a staff member or employee of Twitch
    * Creating an account with a nearly identical name to another Twitch user and attempting to pass yourself off as them
    * Attempting to pose as a representative of a company or organization without authorization (See the [Trademark Policy](https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/trademark-policy/) for more information on usernames that may constitute legal violation of a trademark.)
* Glorification of natural or violent tragedies
    * Glorifying references to specific natural disasters that are responsible for death, such as Hurricane Katrina
    * Glorifying people directly responsible for the murder or death of others, such as serial killers
    * Celebrating deaths of individuals due to violence, including suicides and lethal government or police actions (see Hateful Conduct for more on our guidelines regarding glorifying violence on the basis of a protected class)

[](#)

  In instances where we believe users may be acting in good-faith, we will mandate a username or display name reset instead of indefinitely suspending the accounts. For example, your username may be reset if it includes \[content warning\]:

* References to hard drugs, recreational drugs, and drug abuse (with the exceptions of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana)
    * Explicitly referencing recreational drugs or psychoactive substances, such as peyote
    * Explicitly referencing hard drugs, including cocaine or heroin
    * Overtly glorifying the abuse of prescription or harmful drugs, including practices such as inhalant abuse
* References to pornography, sexually explicit, and sexually suggestive content or behavior
    * Creating usernames that reference explicit or implied sexual acts
    * Creating usernames that indicate overt sexual arousal
    * Creating usernames that include references to genitalia or sexual bodily fluids
    * References to sexually transmitted infections and other types of sexual-related trauma
    * Overt references to sexual fetishes
* Using terms related to sexual orientation or disability in an insulting context or as a negative descriptor   (reminder that using terms related to protected groups in an openly hateful or derogatory way will result in an indefinite suspension, see Hateful Conduct above)
    * Creating a name that uses terms related to Autism or intellectual disability in a negative or insulting context
    * Creating a name that uses terms related to sexual orientation, such as ‘gay,’ in a negative or insulting context

Username resets are leveraged in these cases under the assumption that these violations are likely mistaken or unintentional. However, repeatedly renaming an account in violation of our username policy will result in further enforcement actions against your account, up to an indefinite suspension.

[](#)

  **Username FAQ**

**What is a username reset and how does it differ from an account suspension?**

Username and display name resets force you to change your name but do not result in your account being suspended. If your username is reset through an enforcement action, you will receive an email notification asking you to choose a new username and/or display name. Until you follow these steps and rename your account, you will be unable to access your account on Twitch. Once you have renamed your account, you will be able to use Twitch as normal, and your account history (aside from the offending username) will be preserved.

**Why does Twitch enforce against some content in usernames that would not be considered Community Guidelines violations in other types of content?**

These additional standards are often tied to values that exist in our Community Guidelines, but there are contextual differences in usernames and display names compared to other types of content that change how we approach enforcement. We call out above that usernames are more visible, persistent, and cross-functional than most other types of content on Twitch. Usernames are often the most discoverable part of an account, and they contain very little context at a glance. In some instances, usernames may also be representative of the content or focus of a channel’s activity. As an example of how these differences in standards are applied, while we prohibit pornography on Twitch, using the word ‘pornography’ in chat would not result in an account suspension. However, a username that contained the term ‘pornography’ would be enforced as a violation of this policy with a reset.

**If Twitch has the ability to reset account usernames, why suspend some accounts indefinitely?**

Our suspension data indicates that the vast majority of users who create names that would result in indefinite suspensions create many such accounts, and are often involved in malicious raiding, brigading, and harassment campaigns. Because these individuals harm and spread toxicity within the Twitch community, we indefinitely suspend them immediately in order to mitigate this abuse, as well as remove the username. As with all account enforcements, if you have been suspended under this policy and believe that there has been a mistake or error, you may submit a suspension appeal (instructions can be found [here](https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/appeals)).

**If usernames can be such a large issue, what is Twitch doing to proactively monitor them at account sign-up?**

We do have systems in place to proactively monitor usernames at account sign-up and automatically deny names that appear to violate our policies. However, malicious individuals often leverage a number of tactics to try and confuse these systems. While our automated detection catches a significant amount of this abuse, we also leverage account suspensions and resets to deal with names that do manage to evade or pre-date our filtering system.

Tags
----

You should only create tags that adhere to the rest of Twitch’s Terms of Service and Community Guidelines.

[](#)

  Examples of content prohibited from use in tags by our Community Guidelines includes, but is not limited to, the following (content warning):

* Hateful conduct, such as offensive slurs, symbols, and stereotypes
* Harassment, such as targeted insults, bullying, and threatening or inciting abuse
* Threats of violence, such as threats against others and threats of suicide
* Glorification or promotion of self harm, such as content promoting eating disorders
* Sexual content, such as descriptions of sexual acts (sex, masturbation), arousal, and gestures
* Nudity, such as descriptions of buttocks, genitals, and anuses
* Illegal drugs, such as references to illegal drug use, drugs, and drug paraphernalia

In addition to content prohibited by our Community Guidelines, we also prohibit the following given the high visibility and prominence of tags across Twitch:

* Vulgarity, such as obscene or explicit words and phrases
* Commonly abused terms, such as ‘white’, ‘straight’, ‘cis’, ‘able’ and derivations of these terms. Promotion of these terms have a potential for misuse or connection to hateful ideologies, which are not permitted on Twitch. 

Severe abuse of tags submissions, including severe policy violations and repeated submissions of content previously rejected or taken down, may result in a suspension of your account.

Prohibited Games
----------------

In order to ensure that the content broadcast on Twitch abides by our Community Guidelines and is appropriate for a diverse audience, **we prohibit games that contain developer-generated content that is clearly violative, as well as social platform games frequently used for unmitigated abuse.** Broadcasting or showcasing content from these games will lead to enforcement action against your account. 

Using the Mature-rated Games Content Classification Label, setting the broadcast or VOD to a different title, setting the stream to subscribers only, or categorizing the stream under ‘Not Playing’ does not constitute an exemption from this policy.   
  
Games are restricted from broadcast if:

* The game violates our Community Guidelines as it applies to hate speech, sex, nudity, gratuitous gore, or extreme violence
* The official ESRB rating is Adults Only

Alternate versions of Adults Only titles with an ESRB rating of Mature or lower are permitted, including Mature versions of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy.

Game reviews are conducted following reports from the community. If the game is unrated by the ESRB and a wholly-comparable rated title cannot be found, the moderation team determines whether the game violates our Community Guidelines. Titles may be restricted if they are sufficiently extreme by a single element of the game (e.g. sexual content, violence, intent) or several elements in aggregate violate our policies.

User accounts broadcasting or uploading content that feature gameplay from these titles can be reported via the user report tool under the option "Prohibited Game." Reported users may receive a temporary account suspension. In order to discourage sharing this content, all titles on the list are removed from the game selector found on the Creator Dashboard. 

[](#)

  Example Prohibited Games \[content warning\]

This list is not exhaustive. We regularly update this list and games may be added or removed if the game's official ESRB rating changes or if the content of an unrated game changes. 

* 3DXChat
* All Randomized Video Chat Platforms

Prohibited Gambling Content
---------------------------

**We do not allow users to share links or affiliate codes to sites that contain slots, roulette, or dice games.**

[](#)

  For example, on Twitch you may not:

* Share a referral code to a slots site with your chat
* Include a banner with a link to online roulette games
* Verbally refer your chat to a site containing dice games

Furthermore, similar to our [prohibited games policy](https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Prohibited-Games), **we do not allow the sites below to be streamed on Twitch, or linked to in chat.** We consider many factors in determining whether a site is allowed, including whether the site includes safety protections, such as deposit limits, waiting periods, and age verification systems. We also take into account whether streamers use or encourage VPNs to evade geoblocking, and whether the site is licensed in the US or other jurisdictions that provide sufficient consumer protections.

[](#)

  We do not allow the following sites or associated domains:

* stake.com
* rollbit.com
* duelbits.com
* roobet.com
* blaze.com
* gamdom.com

We may identify others as we move forward.

[](#)

  Enforcement Notes and Clarifications:

_Enforcement Notes are additional examples of what is and isn’t allowed on Twitch, focused on clarifying existing policies already being enforced. Updates here do not indicate a change in policy, but are additional examples of existing enforcements._

* Promotion or sponsorship of skins gambling, such as for CSGO skins, is prohibited under our policy.
* Free or social versions of the prohibited gambling sites are also prohibited.
* We do permit broadcasting websites focused on fantasy sports, sports betting, and poker at this time.
* Images or logos containing any of the listed prohibited gambling sites, mentioned above, are not allowed, and are considered the same as sharing direct links to these gambling sites.
    * Prohibited example: A logo representing any of the listed prohibited gambling sites on the screen at any time or within your bio.
* The restriction on prohibited gambling sites applies whether or not you personally participate in gambling activity. 
    * Prohibited example: Watching or restreaming gameplay from any of the prohibited gambling sites listed above. 

Authenticity
============

Impersonation
-------------

Impersonation is a malicious practice that compromises trust in our service and can harm the target of impersonation. **Content or activity meant to impersonate an individual or organization is prohibited**, including impersonation of Twitch staff, celebrities, companies, or friends.

[](#)

  For example, you may not:

* Impersonate a Twitch partner’s account
* Pose as a celebrity in a streamer’s chat
* Create a “waiting room” i.e. a stream with the title, tag, or description of being a “waiting room” for someone else's stream or channel content that contains no reaction or original content created by the channel owner  
     

[](#)

  Enforcement Notes and Clarifications:

_Enforcement Notes are additional examples of what is and isn’t allowed on Twitch, focused on clarifying existing policies already being enforced. Updates here do not indicate a change in policy, but are additional examples of existing enforcements._

* If you are being impersonated as a streamer on Twitch and the content does not qualify for action under [the DMCA process](https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/dmca-guidelines/) (such as a branded trademark), please report the stream under “Impersonation”. Please provide full information in the report.
    * We take into account a number of factors such as usernames and bios, as well as if the person being impersonated submits the report when determining whether to enforce.

Spam, Scams, and Other Malicious Conduct
----------------------------------------

Spam and other deceptive practices create a negative user experience, decrease trust in our service, and mislead viewers, creators, and advertisers. **Any content or activity that disrupts, interrupts, harms, or otherwise violates the integrity of Twitch services or another user’s experience or devices is prohibited.** 

[](#)

  For example, you may not:

* Post spam, such as large amounts of repetitive, unwanted messages or user reports
* Distribute unauthorized advertisements
* Engage in phishing, spreading malware, or viruses
* Defraud Twitch or others
* Engage in viewership tampering (such as artificially inflating follow or live viewer stats)
* Sell or sharing user accounts, services, or features
* Cheat the Twitch rewards system (such as the Drops or channel points systems)
* Engage in any cheating, hacking, botting, or tampering, that gives the account owner an unfair advantage in an online multiplayer game

We understand that sometimes streamers are victims of account takeover, fraud, or viewbotting directed by a malicious third party. We have methods to detect the responsible party and do not penalize good-faith streamers under these circumstances.  
 

[](#)

  Enforcement Notes and Clarifications:

_Enforcement Notes are additional examples of what is and isn’t allowed on Twitch, focused on clarifying existing policies already being enforced. Updates here do not indicate a change in policy, but are additional examples of existing enforcements._

* Redirecting users to a livestream on another service via links on your Twitch page, QR codes, broadcast titles, and go-live notifications, is prohibited.
    * Links to social media profiles, not directly tied to a livestream and links present in your Bio (About Me) or Panels are still permitted.
* Drops are meant to be earned during live gameplay with your community - not through streaming unrelated content like static images, rebroadcasts of past VODs/footage, or other scenarios where you are not interacting with your community.
    * Allowed example: Streaming a game with drops but taking a small break with a temporary “Be right back” static image.
    * Prohibited example:  Using VODs or static images to stream with the core purpose of “Drop Farming”.
* [Shared Viewership](https://link.twitch.tv/SharedViewership), through utilizing Shared Chat as a tool, is designed to highlight the total number of community members present when two or more streamers are both live and collaborating together. Abusing these tools to artificially promote or inflate viewership without appropriate collaboration is not allowed, with some exceptions as noted below.
    * Allowed example: Two streamers are playing a game and are in the same game interacting with each other over audio (e.g. Stream Together audio or in-game comms).
    * Allowed example: A streamer is working with a brand to appear on their official Twitch account at the same time as the streamer’s own channel for the release of their new game or product utilizing Shared Viewership.
    * Prohibited example: Two streamers are live utilizing Shared Viewership, but no active collaboration (not sharing audio or video) is taking place. Instead, they are simply “hosting” each other with Shared Chat to inflate their Shared Viewcount.
    * Prohibited example: Utilizing viewership to highlight an alt account owned by the streamer.

Suspension Evasion
------------------

Circumventing our enforcement actions undermines the integrity of our service. **For suspended users, a****ny attempt to circumvent an account suspension or chat ban by using other accounts or identities will also result in an additional enforcement against your accounts, up to an indefinite suspension.** For non-suspended Twitch streamers, you may react to a VOD or a livestream from another service of a suspended user, but you may not feature them on your stream as a guest (for example, streaming in the same room or using collaboration software to feature a suspended user as a guest, even in an ensemble).

For purposes of this violation, “feature” is defined as 1) streaming with a suspended user, 2) streams of a group that include the suspended user.

[](#)

  Suspended streamers may not:

* Create a new account in order to evade a suspension issued to your primary account

Streamers allowed on Twitch may not:

* Create a channel that functions to rebroadcast a suspended user’s content (e.g. channel panels and name similar to suspended user and rebroadcasts are presented without commentary)
* Have a one-on-one interview with a suspended user or participate in a stream with a suspended user in a group setting where the suspended user actively participates in your stream
* Attend and stream on Twitch an event hosted by or to celebrate a suspended user

We understand that there may be instances where suspended users appear on your stream due to circumstances beyond your control, such as through third-party gaming tournaments or limited engagement while IRL streaming. However, we expect that you make an effort to not actively promote them in a manner intended to bypass their Twitch suspension. **Please remember, that you are responsible for all content in your streams, including policy violations by third parties**.

Harmful Misinformation Actors
-----------------------------

In order to reduce harm to our community and the public without undermining our streamers’ open dialogue with their communities, we prohibit harmful misinformation superspreaders who persistently share misinformation on or off of Twitch. **We remove users whose online presence is dedicated to (1) persistently sharing (2) widely disproven and broadly shared (3) harmful misinformation topics.** 

This policy is focused on Twitch users who persistently share harmful misinformation. It will not be applied to users based upon individual statements or discussions that occur on the channel. We will evaluate whether a user violates the policy by assessing both their on-platform behavior as well as their off-platform behavior. You can report these actors by sending an email to [our internal investigations team](mailto:OSIT@twitch.tv) with the account name and any available supporting evidence.

[](#)

  Under this policy we cover the following topic areas, and will continue to update this list as new trends emerge: 

* Misinformation that targets protected groups, which is already prohibited under our Hateful Conduct & Harassment Policy
* Harmful health misinformation and wide-spread conspiracy theories related to dangerous treatments, COVID-19, and COVID-19 vaccine misinformation
    * Discussions of treatments that are known to be harmful without noting the dangers of such treatments
    * For COVID-19—and any other WHO-declared Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)—misinformation that causes imminent physical harm or is part of a broad conspiracy
* Misinformation promoted by conspiracy networks tied to violence and/or promoting violence
* Civic misinformation that undermines the integrity of a civic or political process
    * Promotion of verifiably false claims related to the outcome of a fully vetted political process, including election rigging, ballot tampering, vote tallying, or election fraud\*
* In instances of public emergencies (e.g., wildfires, earthquakes, active shootings), we may also act on misinformation that may impact public safety

\*Note: In order to evaluate civic misinformation claims, we work with independent misinformation experts such as the Global Disinformation Index, as well as information from election boards and congressional certification.

Content Labeling
----------------

**You are expected to accurately label your content to the best of your ability.** When choosing a category or tag, please choose whichever best describes your content.

About Account Enforcements and Chat Bans
========================================

### On this page:

* [Account Enforcements](#AccountEnforcements)
* [Appealing an Account Enforcement](#AppealingEnforcement)
* [Account Enforcement Due to Copyright Infringement](#Copyright)
* [Appealing a Channel-Specific Ban](#AppealingChannelBan)

Account Enforcements
--------------------

When content is reported to us, we issue enforcements against accounts that we determine to have violated our [Terms of Service](https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/legal/terms-of-service) and/or [Community Guidelines](https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Community-Guidelines).

We take a number of factors into consideration when we review reports of violations, including the intent and context, the potential for or actual harm to the community, legal obligations and others.

Depending on the nature of the violation, we take a range of actions including a warning, a temporary suspension, and for more serious offenses, an indefinite suspension. Violations may result in loss of privileges, such as being featured on the home page, or in marketing campaigns, participation in programs and events, and/or access to features such as automated emote approvals.

### Warnings

A warning is a courtesy notice for some violations. We may also remove content associated with the violation. Repeating a violation you have already been warned for, or committing a similar violation, may result in a suspension.

### Suspensions

Temporary suspension

Temporary suspensions range from one to 30 days. After the suspension is complete, you will be able to use our services once again. We keep a record of past violations, and multiple suspensions over time can lead to an indefinite suspension.

Indefinite suspension

For the most serious offenses, we will immediately and indefinitely suspend your account.

**On bot accounts:** While we welcome bots that add new features to Twitch chat and Whispers, bot accounts that spam unwanted messages will be banned indefinitely. Bots that exceed messaging rate limits will automatically be blocked from sending more messages. To ensure your bot is not banned, please visit [this link](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/irc/guide/) to our developer documentation to learn about message and command rate limits and how to register your bot.

### Restrictions

If your account is suspended, you may not access or use Twitch services, including:

* Watching streams
* Broadcasting
* Chatting
* Using items you have purchased to use on Twitch, including Bits and subscriptions. For temporary suspensions, you can contact us to make changes to your subscriptions while suspended. For indefinite suspensions, any recurring subscriptions you have purchased will not renew.
* Creating other accounts
* Appearing/participating in the stream of a third-party channel. If a banned user appears in a third-party channel while being suspended, this could cause the suspension of the channel they appear in.

If you are a monetized streamer who receives a temporary suspension, you will not be able to earn any revenue from Twitch monetization tools during your suspension, with the exception of recurring subscriptions that renew during the suspension period. If you are indefinitely suspended, you will not be able to utilize Twitch monetization tools during your suspension and existing recurring subscriptions to your channel will not renew.

### Forced Username Reset

Usernames that are flagged as violating our [Community Guidelines](https://link.twitch.tv/community-guidelines), and do not result in an indefinite suspension, will be forced to rename. When this occurs, the account is locked and cannot be recovered until the account owner completes the username reset process. Once complete, the channel owner will regain access to their account including followers, Bits, and subscriptions.

 [](#Top)

Appealing an Account Enforcement
--------------------------------

### Appeal Types

We will review and consider appeals that satisfy one of the following categories:

1. If you believe you did not violate the Community Guidelines, or if you believe we enforced against your account incorrectly, you may appeal. You may apply for an appeal in this category, regardless of the nature of the violation for up to 6 months following the enforcement.
2. If you have served an indefinite suspension for more than 6 months, toward an enforcement that was correctly applied, you may submit a request for reinstatement. We will review requests for reinstatement following indefinite suspensions for most Community Guideline violations. We will not consider reinstatements for violations of high severity harms, such as violent content. Only one request for reinstatement will be granted per user.

### Appeals Eligibility

**For potential enforcement errors:**

You can view enforcements applied to your account in our [appeals portal](https://appeals.twitch.tv/). From here, if you believe you did not violate our Community Guidelines, or if you believe we enforced against your account incorrectly, you can appeal your enforcement for up to 6 months following the enforcement. There is no waiting period required to submit appeals of this type.

**For requests for reinstatement while serving indefinite suspensions:**

You are able to view [enforcements](https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Enforcement) applied to your account in our [appeals portal](https://appeals.twitch.tv/). From here, you can appeal your indefinite enforcement.

* You must wait at least 6 months from the date you were indefinitely suspended before requesting reinstatement. If you have previously requested reinstatement and were denied, you must wait 6 months before reapplying.
* Requests must include taking responsibility for your actions and an acknowledgement that you violated the Community Guidelines.
* If you have previously requested and received reinstatement, you are not eligible to make another request (only one request for reinstatement will be granted per user).
* Upon reinstatement, you will be on probation for a period of up to 6 months following reinstatement. During this probationary period, any new violations may result in longer suspension lengths than normal, and may lead to another indefinite suspension.

### Appealing a Suspension or Warning

To submit an appeal, go to our appeals portal located at [https://appeals.twitch.tv](https://link.twitch.tv/Appeals). Appeals can be requested for enforcements issued within the last six months, or for your most recent enforcement if you are currently serving an indefinite suspension. Appeals sent via any other means will **not** be considered.

Appeals are reviewed by our Safety Operations team in the order in which they are received. There is no guarantee that enforcements will be overturned. For suspensions of 30 days or less, you may only submit 1 appeal per enforcement. For indefinite suspensions, you may only submit 1 appeal in a 6-month period per indefinite enforcement. Only the owner of the account in question may appeal an account suspension or warning. Abusing or spamming the appeals process, including repeatedly submitting unfounded appeals, may lead to additional penalties, or revoking of appeal privileges.

1. To view your recent enforcements and submit an appeal, log in to the [appeals portal](https://link.twitch.tv/Appeals) using the Twitch account for which you wish to appeal an enforcement. You will still be able to access the appeals portal even if your account is currently suspended.
2. Select the enforcement that you wish to appeal. The enforcement date and enforcement reason will be included alongside each enforcement, along with the suspension length or enforcement type.
3. Your user information will be pre-populated in the form at the bottom of the page. Use the description box to provide more details explaining why you would like to appeal the enforcement.
4. After your appeal has been submitted you will receive an on-screen confirmation acknowledging receipt of your appeal. The status of your appeal in the appeals portal will also be updated to “Pending."
5. Once your appeal has been reviewed, you will receive an email notification containing our decision on your appeal, and the status of your account(s). The status of the appeal will also be updated in the appeals portal to reflect our decision. This will complete the appeals process.
6. If you are a resident of the European Union (EU) and you wish to contest our decision further, you may be able to utilize other legal methods for seeking redress. Please review our [Digital Services Act ("DSA")](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/digital-services-act) help page for more information.

### Appealing Forced Username Resets

If you do not believe that your username violates our [Community Guidelines](https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Community-Guidelines), you may appeal the forced rename. In order to appeal, go to our appeals portal located at [https://appeals.twitch.tv](https://link.twitch.tv/Appeals). Appeals sent via any other means will not be considered.

1. To submit an appeal, log in to the [appeals portal](https://link.twitch.tv/Appeals). You will be able to log into the portal with your account even if it is currently flagged for a username reset.
2. Your user information will be pre-populated in the form at the bottom of the page. Use the description box to provide more details explaining why you believe you were incorrectly flagged for a username reset.
3. After your appeal has been submitted you will receive an on-screen confirmation acknowledging receipt of your appeal. The status of your appeal in the appeals portal will also be updated to “Pending."
4. Once your appeal has been reviewed, you will receive an email notification containing our decision on your appeal, and the status of your account(s). The status of the appeal will also be updated in the appeals portal to reflect our decision. This will complete the appeal process.
5. If you are a resident of the European Union (EU), and you wish to contest our decision further, you may be able to utilize other legal methods for seeking redress. Please review our [Digital Services Act ("DSA")](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/digital-services-act) help page for more information.

To regain access to your account while you wait for your appeal, you must complete the username reset process. If your appeal is successful, you may then revert to your old username.

Account Enforcements Due to Copyright Infringement
--------------------------------------------------

As we explain in our [DMCA Guidelines](https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/legal/dmca-guidelines), if we receive a valid DMCA notification against content you've shared on Twitch, we will generally remove or disable access to the claimed infringing material, and we may disable your livestream and/or temporarily suspend your account. We will also take note of this incident under our repeat infringer policy, and will terminate your account if you are determined to be a repeat infringer of copyrighted works.

DMCA notifications are not handled by our Trust & Safety team, and copyright strikes are tracked separately from enforcements issued for violations of our Community Guidelines. To learn more about how Twitch processes DMCA notifications and your options for responding to a notification, including sending a counter-notification or requesting a retraction, please review our [DMCA Guidelines](https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/legal/dmca-guidelines).

 [](#Top)

Filing a Channel-Specific Unban Request
---------------------------------------

If you have been banned from chatting in a specific channel, you can request to be unbanned using the Unban Request feature, providing the channel owner has this option enabled. Banned users can submit a one-time unban request through the Chat column, which channel owners and moderators can review and take action on anonymously. Channel owners can also set a cooldown period which newly banned users must adhere to before they can request to be unbanned.

How to file an Unban Request:

1. Navigate to the chat column of the channel you are currently banned in.
2. Click "Request Unban" and send your unban request message via the chat column interface. Note that once you have sent your unban request, you cannot edit it.

![](https://assets.help.twitch.tv/article/img/000001977-01u.png)

1. After you submit your request, you will receive an on-screen confirmation that your request was sent and that it is under review. You can view whether your request has been granted or denied by the channel owner/moderators via the chat column.

 [](#Top)

Games are restricted from broadcast if:

* The game violates our Community Guidelines as it applies to hate speech, sex, nudity, gratuitous gore, or extreme violence
* The official ESRB rating is Adults Only

Alternate versions of Adults Only titles with an ESRB rating of Mature or lower are permitted, including Mature versions of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy.

Game reviews are conducted following reports from the community. If the game is unrated by the ESRB and a wholly-comparable rated title cannot be found, the moderation team determines whether the game violates our Community Guidelines. Titles may be restricted if they are sufficiently extreme by a single element of the game (e.g. sexual content, violence, intent) or several elements in aggregate violate our policies.  
  
User accounts broadcasting or uploading content that feature gameplay from these titles can be reported via the user report tool under the option "Prohibited Game." Reported users may receive a temporary account suspension. In order to discourage sharing this content, all titles on the list are removed from the game selector found on the broadcaster dashboard. Using the mature content flag, setting the broadcast or VOD to one of these titles, a different title, or ‘Not Playing’ does not constitute an exemption from this policy.

Example Prohibited Games

We regularly update this list and games may be added or removed if the game's official ESRB rating changes or if the content of an unrated game changes. For more on gaming content restrictions, please read the [Community Guidelines](https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Community-Guidelines).

We encourage you to stream whatever you and your communities are passionate about, as long as that content doesn’t violate our [Community Guidelines](https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Community-Guidelines). However, while content that does not violate our Community Guidelines is allowed on Twitch, not all content or topics are appropriate for everyone, including younger viewers. In those cases, we require that you mark your stream with a content classification label. 

Streamers need to apply content classification labels to indicate to viewers if the stream they’re about to watch contains mature themes related to: **Mature-rated Games; Sexual Themes; Drugs, Intoxication, or Excessive Tobacco Use; Violent and Graphic Depictions; Significant Profanity or Vulgarity; or Gambling.** This includes content from their co-hosts or invited guests. Content classification labels help viewers make informed choices about the content they watch, and also help streamers attract viewers who are more likely to be a good fit for their community. These labels also help brands make better choices about the content they want to advertise next to. 

The below Content Classification guidelines will go into when you need to apply labels and provide specific examples of what does and doesn’t need a label within each content category.

### **When to label your stream**

Content classification labels must be applied according to these guidelines. Streamers whose content meets these guidelines but who fail to apply a label, or apply the incorrect label, will receive a warning, and the correct label will be applied to their stream. Repeated violations will result in the relevant label being applied to the channel for a set duration of time but will not result in a suspension. Content classification labels can be applied to a stream or channel based upon content on any Twitch surface. When in doubt, apply the applicable label to your stream or channel.

I: Mature-rated Games
=====================

If a streamer plays a game with an [ESRB rating of Mature](https://www.esrb.org/search/?searchKeyword=&platform=All%20Platforms&rating=M&descriptor=All%20Content&pg=1&searchType=All&ielement%5B%5D=all), their stream will automatically be labeled. Games with an official ESRB rating of Adults Only are still prohibited (learn more about our [Prohibited Games policy](https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Prohibited-Games)). 

If you’re playing an unrated game, Twitch will automatically assign the correct content label settings if it has enough information from [IGDB](https://www.igdb.com/) to mark the stream appropriately. Otherwise you’ll be responsible for ensuring the stream is marked appropriately using the other provided labels.  

If the featured game is not rated Mature (i.e. the game is rated T or below), the content may still need to be labeled mature if it includes additional elements listed in the guidelines below. For example, streaming an E-rated game while persistently and excessively using strong language will still require a label for Significant Profanity or Vulgarity. 

II: Sexual Themes
=================

While Twitch prohibits nudity, inappropriate attire, pornography, and certain [Sexual Content](https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Community-Guidelines?#20SexualContent), streamers are required to apply a content classification label to certain streams that contain sexual themes, listed below. We also require that streamers label their stream if the content or behavior is very likely to elicit a more mature chat conversation.   
  
Streamers must label their stream if they solicit the content below for money, services, or items of value, including cheering, Bits, subs, donations, or in-game items.  
  
Examples of content that require a classification label include, but are not limited to: 

* Body writing or body art on buttocks or breasts of female-presenting person.
    * Painting a breastplate on your chest during a superhero body art stream
        
* Prolonged or repeated kissing another individual or object, including kissing or licking a microphone. 
    
    * Kissing a significant other for a prolonged period of time on stream
        
    * Continuously licking a microphone for the duration of the stream
        
* Strip teases and other erotic dances that involve actual disrobing or disrobing gestures
    
* Wearing or displaying BDSM-associated attire (e.g. harnesses, blindfolds, collars) or paraphernalia (e.g. whips) displayed or worn without engaging in sexual activity. 
    * Wearing a ball gag on your neck while doing a Just Chatting stream
* Display of sex toys in an educational context.
    * Demonstration of how to use contraceptives that makes use of sex toys or phallic objects
* Non-educational discussions of sexual topics or experiences. 
    
    * Non graphic conversations related to sexual activities, preferences, fetishes, etc. 
        
    * Commentary that centers around sexual jokes or innuendos, including brief instances of sexual noises
        
* Directly encouraging or eliciting conversations in chat that would qualify as containing Sexual Themes as listed above.
    
    * Asking users in chat to describe their first sexual encounter 
        
* Watching or displaying third-party (nested) content that falls under Sexual Themes as listed above.

**Labeling not required:**

Presentation or discussion of sexual health education content related to contraceptives or safe sex practices that does not use detailed graphic language or utilize sex toys; art history educational content or public art that might feature nude figures, popular dance forms (including twerking and athletic pole dancing). 

III: Drugs, Intoxication, or Excessive Tobacco Use
==================================================

While Twitch [prohibits the use of hard drugs and the misuse of legal substances](https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Community-Guidelines?#3Self-DestructiveBehavior), we allow streamers who are of age to consume alcohol, tobacco, or other legal substances while on stream. However, such content may not be appropriate for all users. Examples of content that require a classification label include but are not limited to:

* Appearance or use of marijuana on stream
    
    * Clearly smoking a joint on stream
        
* Appearing clearly under the influence of drugs or alcohol on stream. 
    
    * Slurring speech, stumbling due to drinking too much alcohol or smoking marijuana
        
* Glorifying or prolonged in-depth discussions about excessive consumption of substances like alcohol, tobacco or marijuana
    
    * Demonstrating the fastest way to consume alcohol or marijuana and encouraging users to try it
        
    * Main content of the stream is focused on excessive consumption of alcohol including playing drinking games or setting the stream title to “drunk stream”
        
    * Main content of the stream is focused on popular types of recreational drugs and discussions of drug-related paraphernalia
        
    * Stream is dedicated to promoting an alcohol, tobacco or marijuana brand
        
* Discussion or depiction of either illegal drugs or misuse of prescription drugs
    
    * Sharing experiences with cocaine, non-prescribed use of stimulants, or psychedelics and drug preferences 
        

Being intoxicated to the point of being incapacitated (falling asleep or not being able to stand) or no longer being in control of the stream, drunk driving, use of illegal drugs, and misuse of prescription drugs is still prohibited.

**Labeling not required:**

Brief anecdotes and educational or scientific discussions of alcohol or drugs, legal prescription drug use and discussion. 

IV: Violent and Graphic Depictions
==================================

We require streams to be labeled when they feature violent and graphic content that goes beyond animated or clearly fake depictions of violence. Examples of content that require a classification label include but are not limited to:

* Fictional realistic depictions of violence in media or video games that feature extreme blood and gore. 
    
    * Creating a compilation of scenes from a highly realistic game or live-action movie where multiple characters are violently killed 
        
    * Creating art that features mutilation or gore
        

[Content that displays realistic gore including death, extreme injury, mutilation or bodily fluids](https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Community-Guidelines?#18SensitiveContent) is still prohibited regardless of whether a label is applied.

V: Gambling
===========

Sharing gambling referrals to sites that contain slots, roulette, or dice games is prohibited according to our Community Guidelines, as is streaming or sharing links to [specific sites](https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Community-Guidelines?#26ProhibitedGamblingContent). We require streams to be labeled when they feature live participation in gambling. Twitch will automatically label streams within certain gambling categories, like Slots. Examples of content that require a classification label include but are not limited to:

* Participating in gambling
    
    * Actively betting on sports or fantasy sports while on-stream
        
    * Playing online or IRL slots, poker, or blackjack on-stream
        
    * Engaging in online or IRL gambling on stream regardless of the topic being discussed
        

**Labeling not required:**

Brief gambling content in a non-gambling focused video game (e.g., playing card games in the Witcher III), appearances of gambling in TV/movies, gambling occurring in the background of a stream as long as it is not featured, math/probability examples involving gambling, buying lotto tickets, discussing fantasy sports, and discussions around gambling risks.

VI: Significant Profanity or Vulgarity
======================================

Streams that use extreme vulgar language in a **persistent** and **excessive** manner throughout the duration of the stream must be marked for vulgar language. For example, if strong language is a regular or defining part of your stream or content or you use terms like f\*\*k, c\*\*t, or p\*\*\*y in every other sentence, you must notify users. 

**Labeling not required:**

Intermittent use of vulgar language; brief, occasional outbursts; or more frequent use of mild profanity (e.g., terms like "damn," "shit," or "ass")

VII: Politics and Sensitive Social Issues
=========================================

Twitch is a place for people to express themselves and discuss the world around them. We require streams to be labeled when the focus of the stream includes discussions and debates about political or sensitive social issues such as discussions about elections, civic integrity, war or military conflict, and civil rights. Examples of content that require a classification label include but are not limited to:

* Streams featuring former or current political officials if the content includes discussions with these individuals around public policies
* Live coverage or commentary on elections, civic processes, or election-related disputes

* Livestreams of protests, rallies, or civil unrest related to civil rights issues or government policies
* Discussing military conflicts, foreign policy decisions, or national security matters
* Streams focused on discussing topics like gender, race, sexuality, or religion in a polarizing or inflammatory manner
    

**Labeling not required:**

Streams containing informational or educational content that aim to share knowledge in a neutral, fact-based manner, rather than engaging in any kind of advocacy for an issue or candidate. For example, sharing the history of how votes in the US presidential election are counted to determine the next President, or merely encouraging individuals to vote or register to vote.

Intermittent mentions of politics, politicians, or sensitive social issues are not required to have the Politics and Sensitive Social Issues label.

No label is required if you are speaking about your lived experiences on topics such as gender, race, sexuality, or religion.

You should only create emotes that adhere to Twitch’s [Terms of Service](https://link.twitch.tv/ToS) and [Community Guidelines](https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Community-Guidelines). Examples of content prohibited from use in emotes includes, but is not limited to, the following:

Respect Intellectual and Artistic Property Rights
=================================================

You should only create emotes for which you have all necessary rights. It’s a violation of our policies to create emotes that include unauthorized uses of another person’s content, brand, image, or other rights. Failing to do so, may expose you to a takedown request or legal liability. Twitch reserves the right to remove such material from Twitch. Examples of content you should not use without permission or other authorization include:

* Content that you do not own or otherwise do not have the rights to use on Twitch
* Assets and content from other Twitch creators and channels.
* Another person’s artwork or photographs.
* Content sourced from other types of media, such as games, movies, and TV shows.
* Another person or organization’s name, logo, and other identifying marks.
* The likeness of another person (such as the face of a celebrity or athlete).

FAQ
===

### I think an emote violates Twitch’s rules. How do I report it?

If you find an emote you believe violates the Subscriber Badge and Emote Guidelines, please report it via the User Report tool.  
  
In order to report a subscriber badge or emote, select a reason appropriate for the violation in question and specify the content you wish to report in the description, such as the emote prefix and code for subscriber emotes.

### I am bothered by an emote showing up in my channel but it does not violate Twitch’s rules. How can I avoid seeing it?

If you do not like seeing an emote in your chatroom on your channel, but it does not violate any of our guidelines, you can still hide it from appearing in your channel by adding it to your Channel Banned Words filter. Words - including emote codes - added to this filter box will appear in your chat as \*\*\*.

### What about subscriber emotes?

All subscriber emotes are subject to additional policies detailed in the [Subscriber Emote Guide](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/subscriber-emote-guide). Please keep in mind subscriber emotes aren’t just for use or present on their respective Partner or Affiliate channels; subscriber emotes can be used globally across Twitch services, so these guidelines may be more restrictive.

This article details the rules and guidelines for using tags on Twitch.   
  
If you're looking for a guide that explains what tags are and how to use them, please see our [Guide to Tags](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/guide-to-tags) help article.

Rules and Guidelines
====================

### Respect Twitch Policies

You should only create tags that adhere to Twitch’s [Terms of Service](https://link.twitch.tv/ToS) and [Community Guidelines](https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Community-Guidelines). Examples of content prohibited from use in tags by our [Community Guidelines](https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Community-Guidelines) includes, but is not limited to, the following:

* **Hateful conduct**, such as offensive slurs, symbols, and stereotypes
* **Harassment**, such as targeted insults, bullying, and threatening or inciting abuse
* **Threats of violence**, such as threats against others and threats of suicide
* **Glorification or promotion of self harm**, such as content promoting eating disorders
* **Sexual content**, such as descriptions of sexual acts (sex, masturbation), arousal, and gestures
* **Nudity**, such as descriptions of buttocks, genitals, and anuses
* **Illegal drugs**, such as references to illegal drug use, drugs, and drug paraphernalia

In addition to content prohibited by our [Community Guidelines](https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Community-Guidelines), we also prohibit the following given the high visibility and prominence of tags across Twitch:

* **Vulgarity**, such as obscene or explicit words and phrases
* **Commonly abused terms**, such as ‘white’, ‘straight’, ‘cis’, ‘able’ and derivations of these terms. Promotion of these terms have a potential for misuse or connection to hateful ideologies, which are not permitted on Twitch. 

Severe abuse of tags submissions, including severe policy violations and repeated submissions of content previously rejected or taken down, may result in a penalty on your account. Such actions may include: a strike on the account and/or suspension of account(s). Read more [About Account Suspensions](https://link.twitch.tv/AboutSuspensions).

Account Usernames and Display Names
===================================

In order to ensure that our community is safe and inclusive, inappropriate account names that violate our Community Guidelines are prohibited. We also recognize that an account’s username has more impact across our services than many other forms of content because they are persistent, cross-functional, and, in most cases, much more visible. Because of this, we have additional, higher standards for usernames based on reducing harm across our services. Usernames and display names created on Twitch may not include:

* Breaking the Law, including Terrorism and Child Exploitation
* Violence and Threats
* Hateful Conduct
* Harassment and Sexual Harassment
* Unauthorized Sharing of Private Information
* Impersonation
* Glorification of natural or violent tragedies
* Self-Destructive Behavior
* References to recreational drugs, hard drugs, and drug abuse, with exceptions for alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana
* References to sexual acts, genital, or sexual fluids

Account Usernames and Display Names
===================================

In order to promote a safe and inclusive community, usernames and display names on Twitch must adhere to all of our general Community Guidelines standards. Additionally, we recognize that usernames and display names often have more impact across our services than other forms of content because of their visibility, persistence, and cross-functional nature. In order to account for this, we have additional, higher standards for usernames based on reducing harm across our services. In order to account for these higher standards, which in some instances may be broken by users acting in good-faith, our enforcements for violative usernames are broken down into two categories: indefinite suspensions and username resets.   
  
Indefinite suspensions are issued for usernames and display names that constitute clear violations of our standard Community Guidelines, or that are typically representative of malicious and bad-faith behavior. These situations include:

* References to terrorism or terrorist organizations
    
* References to child grooming or exploitation
    
* Threats, promotions, or calls to real-life violence against others (with exceptions for references to video game or non-hateful historical violence)
    
    * Calling for another group of people to be harmed or killed
        
    * Creating a username that threatens violence against another person
        
* Hateful Conduct, including slurs and derogatory terminology related to protected characteristics
    
    * Creating a username that includes a hateful slur
        
    * Glorifying, promoting, or advocating for discrimination, denigration, segregation, exclusion, hatred, or disgust based on protected characteristics (see our Hateful Conduct policy for more information)
        
    * Creating a username that references a hate group
        
    * Mocking, denying, or glorifying the occurrence of well-documented hate crimes or acts of genocide
        
* Harassment and Sexual Harassment directed towards another person
    
    * Creating a username that is sexually degrading towards another person
        
    * Creating a username that includes insults targeted towards another person’s sexual practices
        
    * Creating a username that includes a personal attack or targeted profanity against another person
        
    * Directing an insulting username towards another person
        
    * Mocking streamers, community members, or their friends and family that have passed away
        
* Threats or promotion of suicide and self-harm
    
    * Glorifying methods of self-harm, including suicide and eating disorders
        
    * Encouraging another person to self-harm or commit suicide
        
    * Registering a username that threatens suicidal action
        
* Personal information of another person leaked without consent
    
    * IP addresses, email addresses
        
    * Mailing addresses, home addresses, private work or school addresses
        
    * Personal or private phone numbers
        
    * Sensitive identification or financial information, such as bank account numbers or government ID numbers
        
* Impersonation of another person, company, or organization
    
    * Attempting to misrepresent yourself as a staff member or employee of Twitch
        
    * Creating an account with a nearly identical name to another Twitch user and attempting to pass yourself off as them
        
    * Attempting to pose as a representative of a company or organization without authorization (See the [Trademark Policy](https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/trademark-policy/) for more information on usernames that may constitute legal violation of a trademark.)
        
* Glorification of natural or violent tragedies
    
    * Glorifying references to specific natural disasters that are responsible for death, such as Hurricane Katrina
        
    * Glorifying people directly responsible for the murder or death of others, such as serial killers
        
    * Celebrating deaths of individuals due to violence, including suicides and lethal government or police actions (see Hateful Conduct for more on our guidelines regarding glorifying violence on the basis of a protected class)
        

  
In instances where we believe users may be acting in good-faith, we will mandate a username or display name reset instead of indefinitely suspending the accounts. These username resets are typically done in situations where the name would violate this username policy, but wouldn’t normally constitute a violation of our Community Guidelines for other types of content. In addition, some violations of our standard Community Guidelines in usernames and display names that are particularly sensitive or colloquial may result in a username reset. These situations include:

* References to hard drugs, recreational drugs, and drug abuse (with the exceptions of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana)
    
    * Explicitly referencing recreational drugs or psychoactive substances, such as peyote
        
    * Explicitly referencing hard drugs, including cocaine or heroin
        
    * Overtly glorifying the abuse of prescription or harmful drugs, including practices such as inhalant abuse
        
* References to pornography, sexually explicit, and sexually suggestive content or behavior
    
    * Creating usernames that reference explicit or implied sexual acts
        
    * Creating usernames that indicate overt sexual arousal
        
    * Creating usernames that include references to genitalia or sexual bodily fluids
        
    * References to sexually transmitted infections and other types of sexual-related trauma
        
    * Overt references to sexual fetishes
        
* Using terms related sexual orientation or disability in an insulting context or as a negative descriptor   (reminder that using terms related to protected groups in an openly hateful or derogatory way will result in an indefinite suspension, see Hateful Conduct above)
    
    * Creating a name that uses terms related to Autism or intellectual disability in a negative or insulting context
        
    * Creating a name that uses terms related to sexual orientation, such as ‘gay,’ in a negative or insulting context
        

Username resets are leveraged in these cases under the assumption that these violations are likely mistaken or unintentional. However, repeatedly renaming an account in violation of our username policy will result in further enforcement actions against your account, up to an indefinite suspension.

FAQ
===

### What is a username reset and how does it differ from an account suspension?

Username and display name resets force you to change your name but do not result in your account being suspended. If your username is reset through an enforcement action, you will receive an email notification asking you to choose a new username and/or display name. Until you follow these steps and rename your account, you will be unable to access your account on Twitch. Once you have renamed your account, you will be able to use Twitch  as normal, and your account history (aside from the offending username) will be preserved.

### Why does Twitch enforce against some content in usernames that would not be considered Community Guidelines violations in other types of content?

These additional standards are often tied to values that exist in our Community Guidelines, but there are contextual differences in usernames and display names compared to other types of content that change how we approach enforcement. We call out above that usernames are more visible, persistent, and cross-functional than most other types of content on Twitch. Usernames are often the most discoverable part of an account, and they contain very little context at a glance. In some instances, usernames may also be representative of the content or focus of a channel’s activity. As an example of how these differences in standards are applied, while we prohibit pornography on Twitch, using the word ‘pornography’ in chat would not result in an account suspension. However, a username that contained the term ‘pornography’ would be enforced as a violation of this policy with a reset.

### If Twitch has the ability to reset account usernames, why suspend some accounts indefinitely?

Our suspension data indicates that  the vast majority of users who create names that would result in indefinite suspensions create many such accounts, and are often involved in malicious raiding, brigading, and harassment campaigns. Because these individuals harm and spread toxicity within the Twitch community, we indefinitely suspend them immediately in order to mitigate this abuse, as well as remove the username. As with all account enforcements, if you have been suspended under this policy and believe that there has been a mistake or error, you may submit a suspension appeal (instructions can be found here).

### If usernames can be such a large issue, what is Twitch doing to proactively monitor them at account sign-up?

We do have systems in place to proactively monitor usernames at account sign-up and automatically deny names that appear to violate our policies. However, malicious individuals often leverage a number of tactics to try and confuse these systems. While our automated detection catches a significant amount of this abuse, we also leverage account suspensions and resets to deal with names that do manage to evade or pre-date our filtering system.
