Community Guidelines
====================

Our Commitment to You
---------------------

### Counter Speech vs. Censorship

We honor the ability of all users to freely express themselves without interference from oppressive censorship or manipulation. In the interest of cultivating a welcoming and inclusive community for all users, we simultaneously acknowledge the harmful impact of hate speech and reject censorship in favor of counter-speech. Users are encouraged to engage positively in discourse when confronted with hate speech, promoting the power of free speech to dissuade, debunk, and disarm hate speech. Creating a respectful and constructive dialogue is a collective responsibility.

Our commitment is to remain viewpoint neutral and objective, providing tools for users to manage content exposure. To tailor your own experience, we encourage you to mute or block followers to create your desired content flow.

We stress the importance of having boundaries to ensure a secure space for everyone to participate in constructive discussions. The following Community Guidelines detail the types of content and engagement that will not be tolerated on our Services and can result in account restrictions, deletions, and/or permanent bans in accordance with our Guidelines Compliance Process.
