Blockchain Integration
----------------------

Parler has integrated blockchain technology into some of its products and services. Blockchain technology provides transparency, security, and decentralization, enabling enhanced user experiences. This integration allows users to actively participate in blockchain-enabled features, such as earning digital rewards for specific actions.

Users acknowledge and agree that blockchain-related features involve emerging technologies and may carry certain risks, including but not limited to potential technical errors, transaction delays, or issues related to blockchain network stability. Parler does not guarantee the performance or outcomes of these blockchain features and is not responsible for losses incurred from blockchain-related actions.

Users are solely responsible for managing their blockchain-related credentials, such as private keys, wallet addresses, or other identifiers. Parler does not store, manage, or recover these credentials for users.

By engaging with blockchain-enabled features, users agree to comply with all applicable laws and regulations governing blockchain use in their jurisdiction.

Parler offers users the optional ability to "Boost" their posts for increased visibility across the Parler platform. Users may elect to pay for a Boosted Post either by (a) paying a flat fee in United States Dollars (USD) or (b) using OPT digital rewards based on the current market value of OPT as determined by CoinStore, an independent third-party digital asset exchange.

Boosted Posts
-------------

By choosing to Boost a post, users acknowledge and agree that:

*   Use of OPT for Boosted Posts is entirely voluntary and at their sole discretion.
*   OPT is a utility token earned through participation and contribution to the decentralized Optio blockchain network. It is not a security, does not represent an investment, and is not reliant upon the efforts of others for its value.
*   Parler does not operate or control CoinStore or any other third-party exchange and is not responsible for any changes in the market valuation of OPT.
*   Parler makes no warranties, representations, or guarantees regarding the value, performance, or future price of OPT.
*   Users are solely responsible for verifying the current value of OPT and making an informed decision prior to completing any Boosted Post transaction using OPT.
*   Parler is not a digital asset exchange and does not engage in the sale, trading, or transfer of OPT.

All Boosted Post transactions are final, non-refundable, and subject to the Terms and Conditions herein.

There can be no guarantee that Boosted Posts will be successful, or achieve particular success. Neither Parler nor Optio is responsible for any aspect of a user's content, website, or applications with which Boosted Posts may be associated.

At any time, for any or no reason, we may terminate Boosted Posts, and you or we may terminate this Agreement. At any time and at our sole discretion, we may update or modify the features or functionality of Boosted Posts, or this Agreement. We may also, at our sole discretion, terminate your participation in or suspend and/or limit your participation in Boosted Posts. Neither Parler nor Optio will have any liability regarding the foregoing decisions.

Tipping (USD and OPT)
---------------------

Parler may provide an optional tipping feature that allows users to send paid interactions, comments, or other paid messages ("Tips") to creators or other users where enabled. Tip amounts and associated messages may be displayed publicly within comment feeds or alongside content.

Users may fund Tips using either:

*   Fiat currency (USD) through third-party payment processors integrated into Parler; or
*   OPT tokens, with token valuations determined solely by independent third-party digital asset exchanges at the time of transaction.

Parler does not control or guarantee the value, availability, liquidity, or price of OPT tokens, and users assume all risks relating to fluctuations or volatility of any digital asset.

All tipping transactions are final and non-refundable. Users acknowledge and agree that:

*   Parler is not responsible for payment errors, processing delays, chargebacks, or third-party transaction failures; and
*   Parler does not mediate disputes between users and creators regarding tipping amounts, content, or expectations.

Users acknowledge and agree that:

*   OPT tokens are utility tokens for use within supported Parler features;
*   OPT tokens are not securities, investments, or financial instruments regulated under U.S. or international securities laws;
*   Parler makes no promises regarding the future value, liquidity, or tradability of OPT tokens; and
*   All transactions involving OPT tokens are at the user's own risk, and Parler is not responsible for any losses resulting from third-party exchange issues, wallet mismanagement, or market conditions.
