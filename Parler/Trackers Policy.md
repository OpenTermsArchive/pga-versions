**Parler’s Disclaimer and Notice**  
Updated: October 23, 2024  
  
Parler’s Mission and Focus Parler is a social media platform built to champion free speech and protect user privacy. With minimal content moderation, Parler fosters an open environment where users can freely express their views. This commitment to transparency and open dialogue aligns with Parler's mission of supporting diverse perspectives in a secure digital space.  
  
**Blockchain-Integrated Apps and Services**  
Beyond social media, Parler develops blockchain-integrated apps and services that interact with the decentralized Optio Blockchain. Through collaboration with Optio Services, Parler expands the functionality of the Optio network, enhancing user engagement with apps that integrate seamlessly with the blockchain. While Parler is involved in the development of these apps, the governance of the Optio Blockchain remains fully decentralized and is managed by Optio Node Owners.  
  
**Blockchain Governance, OPT Digital Rewards, and Future Projection**s  
The Optio Blockchain operates through decentralized governance led by Optio Node Owners, who follow a community-driven constitution. Users can earn points that convert into OPT digital rewards by engaging with Parler apps integrated into the blockchain, which can then be used within the Parler platform. However, there is no promise of financial gain or profit associated with these rewards, as they are not investment products and have no guaranteed value outside of their utility within the ecosystem. Parler’s future projections, while promising, are subject to risks and uncertainties, and outcomes may differ from those anticipated.
