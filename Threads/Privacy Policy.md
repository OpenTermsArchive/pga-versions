Threads Supplemental Privacy Policy

Effective December 14, 2023
===========================

Threads is provided by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited ("Meta", "we", "our" or "us") and is part of Instagram. Threads allows Instagram users to create a Threads profile as part of their Instagram account, and then to share, view, and interact with content on the Threads app and website (“**Threads**”). Alternatively, users can choose to use Threads without creating a profile while still having access to Threads’ key functionality. Your use of Threads, with or without a profile, is governed by the [Threads Terms of Use](https://help.instagram.com/769983657850450).

Threads integrates with third party services (“**Third Party Services**”) via an interoperable protocol, and is part of a network sometimes called the Fediverse. In the Fediverse, Threads users can share content with, view and interact with content from, follow, and be followed by people outside of Threads who use such Third Party Services (“**Third Party Users**”). To enable these interactions between Threads users and Third Party Users we share information about Threads users with Third Party Services, and collect and process information about Third Party Users, even if they don’t have an account on Threads or other Meta Products as described further below.
