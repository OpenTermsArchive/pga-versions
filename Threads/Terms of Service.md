Threads is one of the “[Meta Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/1561485474074139)” and, specifically part of Instagram, so the [Instagram Terms of Use](https://help.instagram.com/581066165581870) and the [Instagram Community Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119) (collectively the “**Instagram Terms**”) also apply to your use of the Threads Service. Any capitalized terms we use here, but do not define below, have the meaning given to them in the Instagram Terms. By using the Threads Service, you agree to these Terms and the Instagram Terms. If there is any conflict between these Terms and the Instagram Terms, then these Terms will prevail with respect to your use of the Threads Service and solely to the extent of the conflict.
