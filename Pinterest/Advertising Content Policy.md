Our mission
===========

Our mission at Pinterest is to bring everyone the inspiration to create the life they love. We believe promoted content can play a big role in helping people create a life they love, which is why we want ads to be some of the best stuff you see on Pinterest. If you follow these guidelines, you’ll be all set for promoting great content on Pinterest.

Be authentic with your audience
===============================

Authenticity means being truthful and honest about the product or service you're promoting. It also means being transparent with people about what they should expect when they interact with your products or services.

#### Be honest about your relationship with Pinterest

Your ads should stick to our and shouldn't suggest that Pinterest is sponsoring your promotion or is formally affiliated with it. Basically, your design should look like it came from your business, not from Pinterest. You can use the word "Pinterest", but not our wordmark.

#### Disclose your billing practices

If you charge users on a recurring basis, be transparent with them and disclose the terms of payment.

#### Respect the rights of others

Your ads can't infringe upon or violate the rights of any third party, including copyright, trademark or privacy rights.

Be respectful with your targeting
=================================

Make sure that your targeting is relevant and that you follow all the below guidelines.

#### Don't target sensitive categories

Targeting certain audiences can be inappropriate and offensive. It's never OK to target people in a way that implies that you're aware of sensitive information about them. You can't target any audience based on:

*   sensitive health or medical condition;
*   race, colour or ethnic origin;
*   Personal hardship, including financial, physical and emotional hardship
*   Religious or philosophical beliefs or affiliation
*   Sexual behaviour, orientation or gender identity
*   Alleged or actual commission of a crime
*   trade union membership or affiliation; and
*   Political affiliation and opinions
*   You also can’t target ads to Pinners under 18 years of age

Please note that the targeting of proxies for the sensitive categories above is also not allowed.

#### Protected groups

Some ad categories have additional targeting restrictions. In addition to the sensitive targeting guidelines, in certain markets, ads in the following categories can’t use actalike, age, gender or postcode targeting options or exclude protected groups:

*   Credit: Ads promoting credit products such as credit cards, mortgages and loans.
*   Employment: Ads promoting employment opportunities, including full-time jobs, part-time jobs and working from home.
*   Housing: Ads promoting the purchase, sale or rental of land or homes.

Bear in mind that age, gender and familial status are protected, in addition to certain groups for which Pinterest prohibits targeting generally. Ads in these categories using prohibited targeting criteria will not be allowed to run. Ads in these categories that target both prohibited and non-prohibited keywords and/or interests may be approved but will not serve on any prohibited targeting criteria.

Be careful with any data usage
==============================

When using data to target or measure ads on Pinterest, you must follow our  and, if applicable, our . This applies to features such as our tag, audiences and app install campaigns.

#### Follow all measurement and audience-targeting rules

Anywhere you collect data used with a Pinterest ads service, you must disclose and get legally required consent from each individual for that data collection, sharing and use.

If you use the Pinterest tag or send us mobile app activity, you must tell your website and app visitors that their information will be shared with third parties for online behavioural advertising, and that they can opt out of online behavioural advertising through their Pinterest , the AdChoices website (if you use the Pinterest tag) or their mobile ad identifier settings (if you share app activity data with us). Don’t give us information that relates to sensitive categories – such as medical condition or ethnic origin – or that’s collected from a child-directed site or app, or from anyone who’s under 13 or the legal age of consent in your country (if higher). Only pass us user identifiers (such as Mobile Ad IDs or hashed emails) in designated fields and according to our documentation.

Do not send Pinterest customer lists that are based on user activity from an app or website on an iOS device. Do not send Pinterest information about any individual who has exercised an option to opt out of having such data used for targeted advertising purposes.

#### Respect our community's data and privacy

For all Pinterest ads services:

You can't:

*   Use data you collect or receive through a Pinterest ads service for any purpose (including audience targeting or user profiling) other than to understand your Pinterest campaigns, and only on an anonymous basis
*   Share data from a Pinterest ads service with a third party, including another advertising service
*   Join data from a Pinterest ads service with personally identifiable information (such as an email address) or information that identifies a user, browser or device (such as a cookie or mobile ad identifier)

If you receive any data from Pinterest tied to a unique identifier (e.g. campaign reporting data linked to a mobile device ID), you can’t use it to market products or services, or for any purpose besides measuring Pinterest campaigns, and you must delete it no later than 6 months after receiving it.

Advertisers using ad products that ask for user information have to follow all .

Advertisers must have a legitimate business reason for collecting the data, respecting the data minimisation principle. Asking for home address and date of birth is allowed with restrictions.

In addition, advertisers must not reference or ask via the Pinterest ads service for the following information related to sensitive categories:

*   Sensitive health or medical conditions, including related to genetics, fertility or pregnancy
*   race, colour or ethnic origin;
*   Personal hardship, including financial, physical and emotional hardship
*   Religious or philosophical beliefs or affiliation
*   Sexual behaviour or orientation
*   Alleged or actual commission of a crime
*   trade union membership or affiliation; and
*   Political affiliation or opinions
*   Pinners under 18 years old
*   Precise geolocation (e.g. GPS)
*   Account numbers, including frequent flyer numbers, loyalty card numbers, cable or telephone account numbers
*   Financial information, including bank account numbers, bank sort code, credit or debit card numbers, tax number, credit score, bankruptcy status, income, net worth or how much debt someone has
*   Government-issue identifiers, including social security numbers, passport numbers, driving licence numbers or ID cards
*   Insurance information, including current insurance policy numbers or other details about a person’s insurance
*   Usernames and passwords
*   Citizen or immigration status
*   Marital status
*   Relationship status
*   Military status

Advertisers should not collect personal data that is not covered in the . If you are not sure whether certain information is covered in the Privacy Policy, please email .

For Pinterest lead ads:

Advertisers promoting prescription drugs, over-the-counter (OTC) products, health-related apps (e.g. heart rate, weight) and/or telehealth services are prohibited from using lead ads.

Advertisers must have a legitimate business reason for collecting personal data from Pinners in a lead ad and must respect the data minimisation principle (i.e. limit the collection of personal data to what is directly relevant and necessary to accomplish a specified purpose). For example:

*   It is allowed to:
    *   Ask for a Pinner’s date of birth or age to advertise an alcoholic beverage; or
    *   Ask for a Pinner’s home address to post product samples
*   It is _not_ allowed to:
    *   Ask for a Pinner’s date of birth and age. Age can be calculated using a Pinner’s date of birth, so collecting both data elements would not respect the data minimisation principle; or
    *   Ask for a Pinner’s home address to send them disclosures, statements or invoices required in the event that the Pinner becomes a customer of the advertiser. In this instance, the advertiser will have an opportunity to collect the Pinner’s home address when said Pinner becomes a customer of the advertiser

Advertisers must not ask for the following information via a lead ad:

*   Sensitive health or medical conditions, including related to genetics, fertility or pregnancy
*   race, colour or ethnic origin;
*   Personal hardship, including financial, physical and emotional hardship
*   Religious or philosophical beliefs or affiliation
*   Sexual behaviour or orientation
*   Alleged or actual commission of a crime
*   trade union membership or affiliation; and
*   Political affiliation or opinions
*   Pinners under 18 years old
*   Precise geolocation (e.g. GPS)
*   Account numbers, including frequent flyer numbers, loyalty card numbers, cable or telephone account numbers
*   Financial information, including bank account numbers, bank sort code, credit or debit card numbers, tax number, credit score, bankruptcy status, income, net worth or how much debt someone has
*   Government-issue identifiers, including social security numbers, passport numbers, driving licence numbers or ID cards
*   Insurance information, including current insurance policy numbers or other details about a person’s insurance
*   Usernames and passwords
*   Citizen or immigration status
*   Marital status
*   Relationship status
*   Military status

Be thoughtful with your editorial
=================================

To keep ads inspiring and actionable, we set high standards for the editorial quality of ads on Pinterest. For tips, check out our creative and .

#### Professional and neatly edited images

Ads should adhere to the highest levels of editorial quality. We don’t allow ads with:

*   Fuzzy, blurry or grainy images (try at least 600x900 pixels)
*   Images with text that is too small or blurry to read
*   Incorrectly oriented images (upside down or sideways)
*   Poorly edited images or poorly cropped images
*   Overly busy images that are packed with text overlay or have too many font styles and colours (try no more than 4 frames and 2 font styles or colours)
*   Images with artificial functionality such as play or download buttons, notification icons, search bars, or elements that mimic Pinterest features (such as our Save or Buy buttons)
*   Elements that mimic Pinterest features (such as our buttons or ellipses)
*   improper grammar, incorrect spelling or excessive capitalisation and symbols.
*   Low-quality user-generated content such as selfies and screenshots
*   Ads with flashing or strobe effects

#### Quality landing pages

We care about the ad experience from start to finish, including the URL your ad links to. We want to make sure users find what they're looking for when they click through. We don’t allow landing pages that:

*   Require people to take an action (such as signing up) before they can see certain content, unless your ad makes it clear that this is required
*   Have pop-up ads or start automatic downloads on someone’s device
*   Force people to visit another page
*   Primarily contain advertising content (made-for-ads sites)
*   Lead to inconsistent experiences

#### Create a consistent experience

Your ads must reflect who you are and what you're promoting, so make sure that your ad image, description and landing page are consistent. Your ads can't suggest or imply that a product is available on your landing page if you don't actually offer that product.
