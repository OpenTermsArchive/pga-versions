Our mission
===========

Pinterest's mission is to provide everyone with the inspiration to create a life they love. Having said that, not all content is inspiring – so we have community guidelines to outline what we do and don’t allow on Pinterest. These guidelines are our acceptable use policy, so if you find content that shouldn’t be on Pinterest, please . We appreciate your feedback and work hard to review your report and take appropriate action in a timely fashion. We use your reports to learn and evolve our standards, and work with subject matter experts to inform and update our guidelines. You can learn more about how we enforce these guidelines in our biannual .

Content safety
==============

Pinterest isn’t a place for antagonistic, explicit, false or misleading, harmful, hateful, or violent content or behaviour. We may remove, limit or block the distribution of such content and the accounts, individuals, groups and domains that create or spread it based on how much harm it poses. Our policies apply to everyone and to all types of content, including synthetically generated content.

We do not allow accounts that belong to violent actors, hate groups or malicious misinformation actors. We may consider off-platform actions in assessing enforcement against a Pinterest account belonging to one of these groups or associated individuals.
