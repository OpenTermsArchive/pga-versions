Our mission

Pinterest's mission is to bring everyone the inspiration to create a life they love. That being said, not all content is inspiring - so we have community guidelines to outline what we do and don’t allow on Pinterest. These guidelines are our acceptable use policy, so if you find content that shouldn’t be on Pinterest, please report it to us. We use your reports to learn and evolve our standards, and work with subject matter experts to inform and update our guidelines. You can learn more about how we enforce these guidelines in our biannual transparency report.

That means we enforce a strict, zero-tolerance policy for any content—including imagery, video, or text— or accounts that might exploit or endanger minors. Pinterest prohibits not just illegal child sexual abuse material (CSAM), but goes a step further to prohibit any content that contributes to the sexualization of minors, including in imagery and text.

The types of content we remove includes:

Spam

We want the inspiration and ideas on Pinterest to be high-quality and useful, so we remove spam when we find it. We ask that you be considerate of others' experiences on Pinterest and don't spread spam or engage in spammy behavior. 

Our guidelines around spam are:

* Don't use automation that hasn't been explicitly approved by Pinterest. This includes unauthorized services that automatically perform actions on your behalf. You can find information on approved partner tools on our Partners website.
* Don't create or operate accounts that aren't authentic, create accounts en masse, or create new accounts for the purpose of violating these guidelines.
* Don't create or save content that is repetitive, deceptive, or irrelevant in an attempt to make money. To learn how to make great Pins, you can always refer to our creative best practices.
* In general, don't attempt to make money from Pinners or Pinner web traffic in ways that are misleading, detract from the Pinner experience, or don't add value for Pinners.
* Don't link to websites that are unsafe, deceptive, untrustworthy, unoriginal, or that facilitate or encourage spam. Websites should have original content that adds unique value for Pinners.
* Don't send repeated, unsolicited messages, especially if your messages are commercial or deceptive in nature.
* Don’t make repetitive or irrelevant comments. Comments should be authentic and original. We also ask that you be kind to others by keeping your commentary respectful and constructive.
* Don't operate multiple accounts or coordinate with other people with the purpose of manipulating the Pinterest platform.
* Don’t use any other unscrupulous tactics to attempt to improperly influence distribution, clicks, or other metrics, including: buying or selling engagement, "stuffing" irrelevant keywords, generating inauthentic traffic, or redirecting existing Pins to new destinations.
* Don't attempt to evade our anti-spam systems. For example, don’t use redirection to attempt to link to a site that is not permitted on Pinterest.
    * With respect to redirection, we encourage you to follow a “no surprises” principle — Pinners should be able to reasonably anticipate where your link will take them. Links that exhibit excessive or deceptive redirection, as well as shortener services that are abused for spam, may be blocked.

Paid Partnership guidelines

What is a paid partnership?

We define a paid partnership as any sponsored or branded content on Pinterest that features or is influenced by a business partner for an exchange of value, such as if a business partner has paid or otherwise incentivized a user to save the content.

What are the guidelines?

All paid partnerships must disclose the commercial nature of their content. In addition to abiding by the Community guidelines, users that participate in paid partnerships must:

* Comply with all applicable advertising laws and regulations
* Include a clear disclosure to indicate the commercial nature of your content (such as the use of #ad to indicate that your content is a paid partnership, or applying a label to your content using Pinterest’s paid partnership tool)
* Adhere to our Advertising guidelines, including the prohibited and restricted content guidelines

To prevent inauthentic content and behavior:

* Make sure you’re posting relevant content to relevant boards
* Keep the content of your posts high-quality and avoid spammy behavior 
* Save content you have an authentic interest in

Don't incentivize or pay people to distribute content in large volumes, in spammy ways or for each Pin they save.

* For example, a business can't pay people for each board they follow or Pin they save. It's okay for a business to pay a guest blogger to curate a board for their brand or through pay-per-click payment structures (such as affiliate links), but they can't pay large groups of people to save specific Pins to artificially inflate the popularity of their content.

We may remove, limit or block the distribution of content or accounts that violate our paid partnership guidelines. If you have questions or encounter problems on Pinterest, you can contact us.

Affiliate guidelines

Affiliate links help content creators measure the impact of their contributions and get paid for the work that they do to bring inspiring content to Pinners. However, affiliate programs can be targeted by spammers trying to make money by abusing the program and manipulating the Pinterest platform.

Our guidelines for affiliates are:

* Always follow our Paid Partnership Guidelines.
* In general, you should operate only one Pinterest account. That account should be your authentic presence on Pinterest.
* Affiliate content should be original and add unique value for Pinners.
* Be transparent about the commercial nature of your content and about your links and their behavior. Some shortener services are not currently supported on Pinterest - if your Pin’s link is blocked, you can edit it.
* Don't try to artificially manipulate Pinterest algorithms or Pinner traffic. Some examples of prohibited behavior include:
    * Using fake accounts to create or save your affiliate links.
    * Asking other users to save your affiliate Pins in a quid pro quo.
    * Asking other users to create Pins with links that include your affiliate identifier.
    * Creating affiliate Pins repetitively or in large volumes - marketers should follow our spam policy and use affiliate links in moderation

We may remove, limit or block the distribution of content or accounts that violate our Affiliate Guidelines. If you have questions or encounter problems on Pinterest, you can contact us.

Contest guidelines

* Don't require people to save a specific image. Give people the ability to choose Pins based on their tastes and preferences, even if it's from a selection or a given website.
* Don't allow more than one entry per person.
* Don't suggest that Pinterest sponsors or endorses you or the promotion.
* Do review our brand guidelines for general rules about using the Pinterest brand.

Lastly, be sure to follow all relevant laws and regulations.
