 

LinkedIn Advertising Policies
=============================

_Last revised on November 18, 2025_

1\. Overview
------------

LinkedIn’s mission is to connect the world’s professionals to allow them to be more productive and successful. We believe that ads delivered through our service should be relevant and useful to our members. These Advertising Policies will help you to determine whether your ad is appropriate for LinkedIn and our members.

2\. The Ad Review Process
-------------------------

In order to maintain the professionalism and integrity of LinkedIn, ads will not run until approved through our ad review process, which checks your ad against the policies we detail below. We strive to review ads as soon as possible and usually do so within 24 hours.

3\. What To Do If Your Ad Is Rejected
-------------------------------------

If your ad is rejected, we’ll provide the reason in Campaign Manager when you hover over the ad status and also via email. If you prefer, you can edit your ad to comply with our policies and resubmit. If you have further questions, please contact us.

4\. Prohibited Content
----------------------

**Professional Community Policies.** Ads must comply with the LinkedIn Professional Community Policies.

**Illegal Products, Services and Activities.** Ads for illegal products, services and activities are prohibited. Ads must comply with all applicable laws, including laws covering what content is allowed in ads and how ads are targeted.

**Discrimination.** LinkedIn does not tolerate discrimination based on personal attributes such as age, gender, gender identity, disability, religion, ethnicity, race, color, national origin or sexual orientation. Ads must comply with this as well as all laws, including laws that prohibit discrimination in connection with education, housing, credit and employment.

**Offensive to Good Taste.** Ads must not be offensive to good taste. This means ads must not be, for example, hateful, vulgar, sexually suggestive or violent. In special circumstances, LinkedIn may determine that an ad that was acceptable is no longer appropriate as we update our policies to reflect new laws or clarify our position.

**Fraud and Deception.** Ads must not be fraudulent or deceptive. Your product or service must accurately match the content of your ad. Any claims in your ad must have factual support. Do not make deceptive or inaccurate claims about competitive products or services. Do not imply you or your product are affiliated with or endorsed by others without their permission. Additionally, make sure to disclose any pertinent partnerships when sharing advertising content on LinkedIn. Do not advertise prices or offers that are inaccurate - any advertised discount, offer or price must be easily discoverable from the link in your ad.

**Trademark Infringement.** Ads must not use trademarks belonging to third parties unless express permission has been granted by the trademark owner or as otherwise permitted by applicable law.
