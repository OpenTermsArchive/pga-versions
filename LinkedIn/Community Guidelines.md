Harassment and abusive content
==============================

As a professional network, LinkedIn maintains a high standard for safe and civil conversations between members. Our policies prohibit a wide range of actions and behaviors associated with harassment, bullying, or other abusive conduct.

We remove content that personally attacks, intimidates, shames, bullies, disparages other LinkedIn members, or is otherwise abusive or uncivil.

Examples of harassment or abusive content

* Directing abusive language, including negative profanity, at other members

Members may express heightened negative criticism and disapproval towards public figures, such as politicians, celebrities, prominent business leaders, or other individuals voluntarily in the public eye.

We also allow members to call out the harassing, hateful, or otherwise abusive conduct of others, so long as the focus remains on driving objective awareness to the behavior, rather than personally attacking or inciting harassment against those individuals. Content that negatively targets others on the basis of inherent traits, like race or gender identity, is enforced under our [Hateful and Derogatory Content](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/137378) policies.

We also recognize that graphic content or content that may otherwise be sensitive for some members, may be shared to raise awareness or condemn. We won’t penalize members for posting content in these circumstances, but we may take steps to label and obscure such content to protect other members who may not wish to see it.
