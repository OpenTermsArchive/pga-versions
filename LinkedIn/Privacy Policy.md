#### **Legitimate Interest**  

Where we rely on legitimate interests we balance the interests the processing supports against your rights and freedoms before processing your personal data, and you have the right to object or to ask for restriction of our processing we describe in this notice at any time.

#### **When does LinkedIn rely on legitimate interests?**

In some cases, the collection and processing of your personal data is based on our legitimate interests and/or the legitimate interests of third parties (e.g., LinkedIn customers and our Members), provided that our interest in processing does not outweigh your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. These interests include commercial interests, the interests of our Members and broader societal benefits. In each instance, we have considered whether these interests are outweighed by your rights and freedoms, and have concluded, based on the limited impact of the processing, the strong safeguards we apply, and the controls we offer you over your data, that we can proceed with the processing.  

If you have questions about how LinkedIn processes your personal data, you can view our [Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy), the many articles and resources on our [Help Centre](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin) or you can [Contact us](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/solve).

#### **Data Sharing with Third Parties**

In addition to Section 3 of our [Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy), we have set our further information below on how LinkedIn may share your personal data for specific purposes with its partners, third-party service providers, customers, regulators and law enforcement agencies, other services such as online search result tools, and our Affiliates including our parent company, Microsoft, and other LinkedIn entities.

#### LinkedIn Developer Programs

Participants in LinkedIn’s Developer Programs can access limited Member personal data via LinkedIn’s Talent, Marketing, Sales and Learning Solutions APIs under our partnership agreements.

LinkedIn may also share your data with third-party service providers and processors. These include our parent company, Microsoft, cloud service providers, content delivery networks, telecommunications providers, maintenance providers, Member support providers, development service providers, market researchers, anti-fraud and anti-abuse services providers, marketing and analytics providers, payment processors, external auditors and advisors, managed services providers, consultancy and professional services firms, such as legal and tax advisors.

#### Regulators and Law Enforcement Agencies

In addition to the above, LinkedIn may also share your personal data with regulators and law enforcement agencies where it is required to do so by law. For more information on this, see section “**Compliance with Legal Obligations**” above.

#### Affiliates

_Our parent company_  

LinkedIn shares data with our parent company Microsoft, as set out in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy) and this Notice, to combat harmful or fraudulent behaviour, to protect the security and integrity of our site and the services of Microsoft and others.  

_LinkedIn Entities_  

LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company shares personal data of all of our Members and Visitors with LinkedIn Corporation in the United States for processing and storage at our data centres, and may share certain personal data with other LinkedIn entities for the LinkedIn group’s business and security purposes.  

With other organisations for safety and security  

We may also share personal data in order to protect the security or integrity of our Services (e.g. sharing examples of security or safety threats with other companies facing similar threats), or the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, Visitors, and others.  

#### **How you can control your data**  

You can access, correct, rectify, delete your personal data, object to or ask us to restrict our processing or change your settings. You have many choices about how your data is collected, used and shared.

  
We offer a variety of ways for Members and Visitors to control their data. The easiest way to control how your data is processed if you are a Member is [via your account settings](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/categories/account) and if you are a Visitor [via your Guest settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls). 

If you are a Visitor and you would like to contact LinkedIn about processing of your data or exercising the rights outlined in this section, you can reach out using the details in the “Contact Us” Section below or by using this [form](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/ask/TS-DPRO).

Members can also object, correct inaccurate data, delete data, port data and in some cases restrict the use of their data as set out in this section:

#### **Accessing your data**

Members can access and download their data at any time. We will provide your data in a structured readable format. You can start the download process from the Data Privacy section of your [Member Settings](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/categories/privacy). You can learn more about how to download your data [here.](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1339364?hcppcid=search)

#### **Correct and rectify your data**

When Members are signed in to our platform you can always review and update your profile information. You can also ask us to change, rectify or not use your data if it is not accurate. You can edit or correct most of your personal data at any time directly in your account settings. If there is any personal data not listed in your account settings that you would like to correct or update you can [complete a data rectification form.](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/ask/TS-DRF) You can learn more about how you can change or correct your personal data [here](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1336621).

#### **Deleting your data**

You can request that we delete your personal data. Most of your profile data can be deleted [through your account settings.](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/categories/account) You can learn more about deleting your data [here.](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1342613?hcppcid=search) For any data that cannot be deleted in your settings, you can submit a [Data Deletion request form](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/ask/TS-DDF). If you would like to delete all your personal data from LinkedIn, you can always choose to [close your account.](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/close-accounts)

#### **Restricting the use of your data** 

One of the ways you can restrict how your data is used is in your [Data Privacy settings](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/categories/privacy) and your [Advertising Data settings](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/categories/ads). You can also request that processing of your data is restricted if the data is inaccurate or if you believe that the processing is unlawful by using the details in the “Contact Us” Section below or by using this [form](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/ask/TS-DPRO). 

#### **Objecting to the use of your data** 

You also have the right to object to processing your data where legitimate interest or public interest is the legal basis for processing that data. To exercise your right to object you can contact us by using the details in the “Contact Us” Section below or complete our [Data Processing Objection form](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/ask/TS-DPRO). 

Where you raise an objection, we will consider your request, our legal obligations, and whether we have a compelling interest in continuing to process your data. In certain cases, consistent with your legal rights and our obligations, we may not be able to fulfil your request—for example, we cannot stop processing your IP address when it is used to authenticate your login details, as this is a security measure that is essential to protect our site. In contrast, you can remove information about your education or work experience from your profile (although as a result, the job recommendations you receive may not be relevant to you) so that we don’t process it. 

Where we use your data for direct marketing (e.g. to send you marketing emails) or profiling for the purposes of direct marketing, you always have the right to object and we will stop using your data for this purpose.

#### **Portability** 

If we use your personal data to perform a contract with you, or with your consent, you have the right to receive your data and port it to another controller. You can download your data anytime in a structured readable format. You can start the download process from the Data Privacy section of your [Member Settings](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/categories/privacy) and can learn more about how to download your data [here.](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1339364?hcppcid=search) LinkedIn also provides an [API program](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/dma/member-data-portability/member-data-portability-member) to enable third parties to build integrations with LinkedIn to port data on a Member’s consent in the EEA, EU and Switzerland only. You can find more details in the [Member Portability APIs](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a6214075) help centre article.

#### **Withdrawing your consent**

When you give us consent to use your personal data, you can withdraw that consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent via Member settings for certain processing, or by contacting us [here](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fhelp%2Flinkedin%2Fask%2Fppq&data=05%7C02%7Cssundholm%40linkedin.com%7Cda78086e62bc43d9651708dcc759ec40%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C0%7C0%7C638604436264149657%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=KFnKedvcckZE6sfyxXqL%2FjkCdzKxwi%2B5WmejCVGH3Lk%3D&reserved=0). When you withdraw your consent, this won’t affect our use of your data up to that point.

#### **Joint Controller Relationship**

We share insights with entities who have LinkedIn Business Pages on our platform, which include certain Member profile information and interaction data. We are a joint controller with the organisation or legal entity who administers the Business Page for this purpose, and Members can find out more information about LinkedIn’s responsibilities [here](https://legal.linkedin.com/pages-joint-controller-addendum).

#### **Data Retention**

We generally retain your personal data as long as you keep your account open or as needed to provide you Services. This includes data you or others provided to us and data generated or inferred from your use of our Services. Even if you only use our Services when looking for a new job every few years, we will retain your information and keep your profile open, unless you close your account. In some cases we choose to retain certain information (e.g., insights about Services use) in a depersonalised or aggregated form.   

You can [delete data from your profile or your activity](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1342613) on LinkedIn. If you close your account with LinkedIn, it is closed immediately. However, it may take up to 72 hours for your public profile to be removed from LinkedIn. Search engines like Bing, Google and Yahoo! may still display your information temporarily due to the way they collect and update their search data. Learn more about [how your profile shows up in search engine results](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1376045/). Where we share your data with other third parties, as set out in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy), e.g. via the LinkedIn Developer Program, they may retain data in accordance with their own retention policies, or in line with our contractual agreements with them.   

For data that LinkedIn collects using cookies, you can see how long LinkedIn processes it for by checking the expiration periods in our [Cookie table](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/l/cookie-table). LinkedIn may also collect information about you from cookies on third party websites. For data collected from third party websites where a LinkedIn customer has installed LinkedIn’s tag, LinkedIn de-identifies your personal data after 7 days and permanently deletes it after 180 days.  

There are a number of reasons why we might need to retain some of your data for longer than usual. These may include:

* Where LinkedIn has suspended your account for inappropriate, harmful or illegal activity that breaches our Professional Community Guidelines and/or we need to resolve complaints relating to your account.
* Where there is ongoing or potential legal or regulatory proceedings related to your account.
* Where we are required by law to retain your data. For more information on when we may be required to retain your data for these purposes, see the “**Compliance with Legal Obligations**” section above.  
    

#### **Transfers of your data outside the Designated Countries and the UK** 

LinkedIn may transfer personal data outside of the Designated Countries and the UK as part of its Services e.g. LinkedIn stores personal data on its servers located in the US, so data flows from the EU, EEA, United Kingdom and Switzerland to the US, and back. LinkedIn will always use a lawful transfer mechanism to transfer your data outside of the Designated Countries including transfers based on an adequacy decision by an approved authority, standard contractual clauses or, where appropriate, derogations permitted by law.   

LinkedIn is certified to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and you can find out more information about our participation in the Data Privacy Framework [here](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1343190).  

LinkedIn also relies on the European Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of certain personal data from the EU/EEA and Switzerland and on the UK Data Transfer Addendum for certain transfers from the UK. These clauses are contractual commitments between companies (e.g. between LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company and LinkedIn Corporation or suppliers). You can request a copy of LinkedIn’s Standard Contractual clauses [here](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/ask/ppq).

#### **Contacting your Supervisory Authority**

If you have a concern or complaint about the use of your personal data that you feel has not been addressed by us, you always have the right to raise a concern with the supervisory authority in your jurisdiction.
