Privacy Policy
==============

**Last updated: August 2025**

If you are a minor, and are not sure you understand everything in this Policy, please make sure to speak with a trusted adult before using BeReal. Please also remember that BeReal is not meant to be used if you are under 13. If you are over 13 but under 16 years old, your parent or guardian must approve your use of the app.

In this Privacy Policy, we will explain what information we collect about you, how we use it, when we share it, and the controls we provide you to manage the information you share with us.

### 1\. Information we process about you

BeReal (the ‘**App**’) collects information that you provide directly to us, through your use of our App and your visit to our website or shared by third-parties.

#### 1.1 Data that you provide to us

**Account Creation Data**: when you create an account on our App, we will ask you for the following information. Without it, we cannot provide you access to the App:

●     Your phone number, full name, date of birth and username.

●     The email address of a parent or guardian, for users under 16 years old.

During (or after) account creation there is also some additional information you can decide to share with us:

●     A biography, your location (as precise as you want), and a profile picture.

**Content Data:** when you use the App, you can decide to share the following data:

●     Photos and videos that you take (“**Content**”) using the app or photos that you share from your library. You can create an account without allowing us to access and collect data from your device’s camera or photo library. However, you will only be able to see your friends’ Content when you have posted your own BeReal. It’s a foundational part of how BeReal works.

●     Your GPS location: you can decide to share your GPS location when you share Content through our App. If you choose to share your location and you are not a child, by default, your precise location – street level – is shared but you can switch it to your approximate location – city level. If you are a child, your approximate location is shared by default and only if you choose to share it.

●     Your reaction to your friends’ Content: RealMojis, emojis, captions and comments.

**Chat Data:** when you use the BeReals chat function, we collect the messages, photos and videos you share with your friends within the chat.

**Communications with BeReal**: When you report a concern with our App, respond to a survey, request assistance, we collect the following data:

●     Your email address,

●     Content of communication with us,

●     Photos you may decide to share with us,

●     Copies of government issued identification (only when strictly required to identify you with certainty),

●     Identifiers (e.g., phone numbers or email address),

●   Any other information you may decide to share with us.

#### 1.2 Data we collect when you use our App or visit our website

Like all internet based services, as you use our App or visit our website, we automatically receive information about you from your device and your usage of our App and your visit of our website. Most information is collected through trackers:

a.       Through the use of our website:

**Connection and Technical Data** such as IP address, device type, operating system version, browser, language preference, and browsing data.

b.       Through your use of the App:

**Connection and Technical Data such as:**

●     IP address, account creation date, last login, terminal equipment and port, operating system, system configuration data, device type, operating system version, browser, language preference, and applications.

●     user\_id (unique identifier generated at account creation), device\_id (unique identifier generated when connecting on new device) and Amplitude ID.

**Mobile advertising IDs and device identifiers:**

We collect technical identifiers developed by mobile operating systems for advertising purposes which remain under your control and can be reset or erased at any time in through your device settings :

●     Mobile advertising IDs (e.g., Apple IDFA if you use iOS or Google AAID if you use Android).

●     Device identifiers (e.g., IDFV for iOS devices and Android ID for Android devices).

**Interaction Data:**

●     Friend (number of friends, friend invitations, the friends with whom you interact the most).

**Inferred information:** We will analyse Account Creation Data and the Content Data to infer information about you:

●     Your time zone.

●    Your interests.

**Usage Data:** actions performed on the App or our website, time of posting Content, how many times you retook a photo before posting, number of BeReal posts, Content viewed, Content interactions, the fact that you deleted Content, or that you blocked users, when you take a screenshot in our App, application crashes, pages visited and event logs.

**Geolocation Data**: when you use our app, we infer your country, city, region based on your IP address.

**Address Book Data**: You can decide to allow BeReal to access your address book to identify the friends in your Address Book who may already be on BeReal or to recommend you new friends. We do not access your Address Book without your permission. Bear in mind that even if you don’t agree to share your Address Book with us, we can still make personalized friends’ suggestions to you based on your contact details that we received from your friends who use our app (see below). You can revoke your permission to access your Address Book Data at any time through your device settings. Once access is revoked, we will no longer collect or update contact information from your address book, and previously uploaded contact data will be deleted within a reasonable time.

**Integrations with partners**: When you decide to connect a partner application (for example Spotify) to use a specific integration on BeReal, we receive information that allows us to bring that feature to you. This will include all necessary device data, and other optional data that you may choose to share as part of the integration.

#### 1.3 Information about you provided by third parties

We may receive information about you from other users of our app. For instance, if other users know you and choose to use contact importing, they may share your Address Book Data details such as your phone number with us, just as you may share theirs. Where friends of yours use contact importing, we may suggest you as a friend to them, and them as a friend to you or they can find you via our search tool.

When you use certain social features of BeReal—such as inviting a contact or sharing a post—we may send an SMS message to that person on your behalf using the phone number you’ve provided (e.g., from your synced contacts). These messages may include a link to the content or an invitation to join BeReal. Recipients can opt out of future messages by following the instructions included in the SMS.

We will also receive the information about where you came from to download the App (for example, if you clicked on an ad on another social media) from our partners.
