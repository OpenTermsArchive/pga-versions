The X Rules
===========

X's purpose is to serve the public conversation. Violence, harassment and other similar types of behavior discourage people from expressing themselves, and ultimately diminish the value of global public conversation. Our rules are to ensure all people can participate in the public conversation freely and safely.

Violent Speech Policy
=====================

### Overview 

**October 2023**

**You may not threaten, incite, glorify, or express desire for violence or harm.**

X is a place where people can express themselves, learn about what’s happening, and debate global issues. However, healthy conversations can’t thrive when violent speech is used to deliver a message. As a result, we may remove or reduce the visibility of violent speech in order to ensure the safety of our users and prevent the normalization of violent actions.  
 

### What is in violation of this policy? 

**Violent Threats**  

You may not threaten to inflict physical harm on others, which includes (but is not limited to) threatening to kill, torture, sexually assault, or otherwise hurt someone. This also includes threatening to damage civilian homes and shelters, or infrastructure that is essential to daily, civic, or business activities.

**Wish of Harm**

You may not wish, hope, or express desire for harm. This includes (but is not limited to) hoping for others to die, suffer illnesses, tragic incidents, or experience other physically harmful consequences.

**Incitement of Violence**

You may not incite, promote, or encourage others to commit acts of violence or harm, which includes (but is not limited to) encouraging others to hurt themselves or inciting others to commit atrocity crimes including crimes against humanity, war crimes or genocide. This also includes using coded language (often referred to as "dog whistles") to indirectly incite violence.

**Glorification of Violence**

You may not glorify, praise, or celebrate acts of violence where harm occurred, which includes (but is not limited to) expressing gratitude that someone experienced physical harm or praising [Violent entities](https://help.twitter.com/rules-and-policies/violent-entities) and [Perpetrators of Violent Attacks](https://help.twitter.com/rules-and-policies/perpetrators-of-violent-attacks). This also includes glorifying animal abuse or cruelty.

### What is not a violation of this policy?  

We make sure to evaluate and understand the context behind the conversation before taking action, and we allow expressions of violent speech when there is no clear abusive or violent context, such as (but not limited to) hyperbolic and consensual speech between friends, or during discussion of video games and sporting events. 

We also allow certain cases of figures of speech, satire, or artistic expression when the context is expressing a viewpoint rather than instigating actionable violence or harm.

### What happens if you violate this policy?  

In certain cases, we will immediately and permanently suspend any account that violates this policy. However, for most violations, we may instead temporarily lock you out of your account before you can Post again. In rare cases, we may make the violative content less visible by [restricting its reach](https://help.twitter.com/rules-and-policies/enforcement-options) on X. However, if you continue to violate this policy after receiving a warning, your account may be permanently suspended. 

We also recognize that conversations regarding certain individuals credibly accused of severe violence may prompt outrage and associated violent speech. In these limited cases, we may take less punitive measures.  

Learn more about [our range of enforcement options](https://help.twitter.com/rules-and-policies/enforcement-options.html). If someone believes we took an enforcement action in error, they can [submit an appeal](https://help.twitter.com/forms/account-access/appeals.html).

Violent and hateful entities policy
===================================

### Overview

**  
April 2023**

There is no place on X for violent and hateful entities, including (but not limited to) terrorist organizations, violent extremist groups, [perpetrators of violent attacks](https://help.twitter.com/rules-and-policies/perpetrators-of-violent-attacks), or individuals who affiliate with and promote their illicit activities. The violence and hate these entities engage in and/or promote jeopardizes the physical safety of those targeted.

**You may not threaten terrorism and/or violent extremism, nor promote violent and hateful entities.**

Violent entities are those that deliberately target humans or essential infrastructure with physical violence and/or violent rhetoric as a means to further their cause. These include, but are not limited to, terrorist organizations, violent extremist groups, and [perpetrators of violent attacks](https://help.twitter.com/rules-and-policies/perpetrators-of-violent-attacks). 

Hateful entities are those that have systematically and intentionally promoted, supported and/or advocated for [hateful conduct](https://help.twitter.com/rules-and-policies/hateful-conduct-policy), which includes promoting violence or engaging in targeted harassment towards a protected category.

### What is in violation of this policy?

Under this policy, you can’t affiliate with or promote the activities of violent and hateful entities. Examples of the types of content that violate this policy include, but are not limited to, doing the following on behalf of, indirectly, or directly for a violent or hateful entity:

* Engaging in or promoting violent acts
* Recruiting, or providing or distributing services (such as media/propaganda) to further stated goals

### What is not a violation of this policy?

We may make limited exceptions for violent and hateful entities if we can determine the following:

* They have reformed or denounced their violence and/or hate-based purpose.
* They are currently engaged in a peaceful resolution process.
* They are state or governmental entities, including those that have representatives elected to public office.

Additionally, any discussions of violent and hateful entities for clearly educational, documentary, and/or newsworthy purposes is not a violation of this policy.

Child sexual exploitation policy
================================

### Overview 

**October 2020**

**We have a zero-tolerance child sexual exploitation policy on X.**

X has **zero tolerance towards any material that features or promotes child sexual exploitation**, one of the most serious violations of the [Our Rules](https://help.twitter.com/rules-and-policies/twitter-rules). This may include media, text, illustrated, or computer-generated images. Regardless of the intent, viewing, sharing, or linking to child sexual exploitation material contributes to the re-victimization of the depicted children. This also applies to content that may further contribute to victimization of children through the promotion or glorification of child sexual exploitation. For the purposes of this policy, a minor is any person under the age of 18.   
  

### What is in violation of this policy? 

Any content that depicts or promotes child sexual exploitation including, but not limited to: 

* visual depictions of a child engaging in sexually explicit or sexually suggestive acts;
* illustrated, computer-generated or other forms of realistic depictions of a human child in a sexually explicit context, or engaging in sexually explicit acts; 
* sexualized commentaries about or directed at a known or unknown minor; and
* links to third-party sites that host child sexual exploitation material.  
     

The following behaviors are also not permitted:   

* sharing fantasies about or promoting engagement in child sexual exploitation;
* expressing a desire to obtain materials that feature child sexual exploitation;
* recruiting, advertising or expressing an interest in a commercial sex act involving a child, or in harboring and/or transporting a child for sexual purposes;
* sending sexually explicit media to a child;
* engaging or trying to engage a child in a sexually explicit conversation;
* trying to obtain sexually explicit media from a child or trying to engage a child in sexual activity  through blackmail or other incentives;
* identifying alleged victims of childhood sexual exploitation by name or image; and
* promoting or normalizing sexual attraction to minors as a form of identity or sexual orientation.   
     

### What is not a violation of this policy? 

* Discussions related to child sexual exploitation are permitted, provided they don’t normalise, promote or glorify child sexual exploitation **in any way**;
* Conversations about help-seeking behaviour of individuals who may struggle with an attraction to minors;
* Advocacy against illegal or harmful activity involving minors provided there is no sharing of, or linking to any material featuring child sexual exploitation; and
* Depictions of nude minors in a non-sexualized context or setting may be permitted in a limited number of scenarios (e.g., art works by internationally renowned artists that feature minors, news media reportage, media created and shared for scientific or educational purposes).  
     

### Who can report violations of this policy? 

Anyone can report potential violations of this policy, whether they have an X account or not.   
 

### How can I report violations of this policy? 

If you think you've found an X account distributing or promoting child sexual exploitation, [you can report it via our child sexual exploitation form](https://help.twitter.com/forms/cse). Provide the username and links to all relevant Posts that led you to believe the account should be reviewed.   
 

### What happens if you violate this policy? 

In the majority of cases, the consequence for violating our child sexual exploitation policy is **immediate and permanent suspension**. In addition, violators will be prohibited from creating any new accounts in the future. Note: when we’re made aware of content depicting or promoting child sexual exploitation, including links to third party sites where this content can be accessed, they will be removed without further notice and reported to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC).

In a limited number of situations, where we haven’t identified any malicious intent, we will require you to remove this content. We will also temporarily lock you out of your account before you can Post again. Further violations will lead to your account being permanently suspended. If you believe that your account was suspended in error, you can [submit an appeal.](https://help.twitter.com/forms/general?subtopic=suspended)  
  

### Additional resources 

Learn more about our [range of enforcement options](https://help.twitter.com/rules-and-policies/enforcement-options) and our approach to [policy development and enforcement](https://help.twitter.com/rules-and-policies/enforcement-philosophy).

If you’ve found content elsewhere on the internet that is distributing or promoting child sexual exploitation, you should [file a report with NCMEC](http://www.missingkids.org/gethelpnow/cybertipline), or with your local law enforcement. If you believe the content is hosted on a website outside of the United States, you can report it on the [International Association of Internet Hotlines website](https://www.inhope.org/EN#hotlineReferral).

We partner with multiple organisations whose work is dedicated to fighting child sexual exploitation around the world. Please see the full list of [our child protection partners](https://about.twitter.com/safety/safety-partners.html#child-protection-partners).

Hateful Conduct
===============

### Overview 

**April 2023**

You may not directly attack other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, caste, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease. 

X's mission is to give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information, and to express their opinions and beliefs without barriers. Free expression is a human right – we believe that everyone has a voice, and the right to use it. Our role is to serve the public conversation, which requires representation of a diverse range of perspectives. 

We recognize that if people experience abuse on X, it can jeopardize their ability to express themselves. Research has shown that some groups of people are disproportionately targeted with abuse online. For those who identify with multiple underrepresented groups, abuse may be more common, more severe in nature, and more harmful.

We are committed to combating abuse motivated by hatred, prejudice or intolerance, particularly abuse that seeks to silence the voices of those who have been historically marginalized. For this reason, we prohibit behavior that targets individuals or groups with abuse based on their perceived membership in a protected category.  

If you see something on X that you believe violates this policy, please [report it to us](https://help.twitter.com/en/forms/safety-and-sensitive-content/abuse.html).

### What is in violation of this policy?  

We will review and take action against reports of accounts targeting an individual or group of people with any of the following behavior, whether within Posts or Direct Messages. 

**Hateful references  
  
**We prohibit targeting individuals or groups with content that references forms of violence or violent events where a protected category was the primary target or victims, where the intent is to harass. This includes, but is not limited to media or text that refers to or depicts:

* genocides, (e.g., the Holocaust);
* lynchings.

**Incitement  
**

We prohibit inciting behavior that targets individuals or groups of people belonging to protected categories. This includes:

* inciting fear or spreading fearful stereotypes about a protected category, including asserting that members of a protected category are more likely to take part in dangerous or illegal activities, e.g., “all \[religious group\] are terrorists.”
* inciting others to harass members of a protected category on or off platform, e.g., “I’m sick of these \[religious group\] thinking they are better than us, if any of you see someone wearing a \[religious symbol of the religious group\], grab it off them and post pics!“
* inciting others to discriminate in the form of denial of support to the economic enterprise of an individual or group because of their perceived membership in a protected category, e.g., “If you go to a \[religious group\] store, you are supporting those \[slur\], let’s stop giving our money to these \[religious slur\].” This may not include content intended as political in nature, such as political commentary or content relating to boycotts or protests.

Note: content intended to incite violence against a protected category is prohibited under [Violent Speech](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/violent-speech.html).

**Slurs and Tropes**  
  
We prohibit targeting others with repeated slurs, tropes or other content that intends to degrade or reinforce negative or harmful stereotypes about a protected category. In some cases, such as (but not limited to) severe, repetitive usage of slurs, or racist/sexist tropes where the context is to harass or intimidate others, we may require Post removal. In other cases, such as (but not limited to) moderate, isolated usage where the context is to harass or intimidate others, we may limit Post visibility as further described below.

**Dehumanization**

We prohibit the dehumanization of a group of people based on their religion, caste, age, disability, serious disease, national origin, race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, or sexual orientation.

**Hateful Imagery** 

We consider hateful imagery to be logos, symbols, or images whose purpose is to promote hostility and malice against others based on their race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or ethnicity/national origin. Some examples of hateful imagery include, but are not limited to:

* symbols historically associated with hate groups, e.g., the Nazi swastika;
* images depicting others as less than human, or altered to include hateful symbols, e.g., altering images of individuals to include animalistic features; or
* images altered to include hateful symbols or references to a mass murder that targeted a protected category, e.g., manipulating images of individuals to include yellow Star of David badges, in reference to the Holocaust.

Media depicting hateful imagery is not permitted within live video, account bio, profile or header images. All other instances must be marked as sensitive media. Additionally, sending an individual unsolicited hateful imagery is a violation of this policy. 

**Hateful Profile**

You may not use hateful images or symbols in your profile image or profile header. You also may not use your username, display name, or profile bio to engage in abusive behavior, such as targeted harassment or expressing hate towards a person, group, or protected category.

### Do I need to be the target of this content for it to be a violation of the X Rules?  

Some Posts may appear to be hateful when viewed in isolation, but may not be when viewed in the context of a larger conversation. For example, members of a protected category may refer to each other using terms that are typically considered as slurs. When used consensually, the context behind these terms is not abusive, but a means to reclaim terms that were historically used to demean individuals.  

When we review this type of content, it may not be clear whether the context is to abuse an individual on the basis of their protected status, or if it is part of a consensual conversation. To help our teams understand the context, we sometimes need to hear directly from the person being targeted to ensure that we have the information needed prior to taking any enforcement action.

**Note:** individuals do not need to be a member of a specific protected category for us to take action. We will never ask people to prove or disprove membership in any protected category and we will not investigate this information. 

### What happens if you violate this policy?  

Under this policy, we take action against behavior that targets individuals or an entire protected category with hateful conduct, as described above. Targeting can happen in a number of ways, for example, mentions, including a photo of an individual, referring to someone by their full name, etc.

When determining the penalty for violating this policy, we consider a number of factors including, but not limited to the severity of the violation and an individual’s previous record of rule violations. The following is a list of potential enforcement options for content that violates this policy:

* Making content less visible on X by:
    * Removing the Post from search results, in-product recommendations, trends, notifications, and home timelines 
        
    * Restricting the Post discoverability to the author’s profile
        
    * Downranking the Post in replies
        
    * Restricting Likes, replies, Reposts, Quote, bookmarks, share, pin to profile, or engagement counts 
        
    * Excluding the Post from having ads adjacent to it
        
* Excluding Posts and/or accounts in email or in-product recommendations. 
    
* Requiring Post removal.
    * For example, we may ask someone to remove the violating content and serve a period of time in read-only mode before they can Post again.
* Suspending accounts that violate our Hateful Profile policy.

Learn more about our [range of enforcement options](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/enforcement-options.html). 

If someone believes their account was suspended in error, they can [submit an appeal](https://help.twitter.com/en/forms/account-access/appeals.html).

Perpetrators of Violent Attacks
===============================

Overview

**February 2023**

**We will remove any accounts maintained by individual perpetrators of terrorist, violent extremist, or mass violent attacks, as well as any accounts glorifying the perpetrator(s), or dedicated to sharing manifestos and/or third party links where related content is hosted. We may also remove Posts disseminating manifestos or other content produced by perpetrators.**

We want X to be a place where people can find reliable information and express themselves freely and safely without feeling burdened by unhealthy content. In the aftermath of terrorist, violent extremist and mass violent attacks, we know many want to express compassion for victims, condemn the attacks and/or the perpetrators, and discuss how these incidents impact people and their communities. Some might also wish to share manifestos or other similar content produced by the attack’s apparent perpetrator or an accomplice, either to express outrage or condemnation of the perpetrator’s possible motives. 

The violence that these perpetrators engage in, and the rationale they outline in manifestos or other means that normalizes hatred and discrimination, may further jeopardize the physical safety and well-being of those who are targeted, and has the potential to inspire future attacks. Exposure to these materials may also cause harm to those that view them. 

We believe the hateful and discriminatory views promoted in content produced by perpetrators are harmful for society and their dissemination should be limited in order to prevent perpetrators from publicizing their message. As a result we may remove Posts that include manifestos or other similar material produced by perpetrators, even if the context is not abusive. However, we may allow newsworthy content if it does not:

* Convey suggestions about how to arm oneself and choose targets;
* Share hateful slogans, symbols, memes, and/or hateful conspiracy theories;
* Outline the perpetrator’s ideology, tactical choices, and/or plan of attack.

**What is a manifesto?**

We define a manifesto as a statement by a perpetrator outlining their motivation, views, or intent to engage in a violent attack. A manifesto can be in the form of a written document, social media post, audio recording, video, external link, or letter or other forms of content. It may be shared in the aftermath, or at any period before a violent attack. A manifesto can be linked to the event through a statement of warning or intent.

**Who are the individual perpetrators of terrorist, violent extremist, and mass violent attacks?**

Violent attacks claimed by a violent organization or by a member of such organizations are covered under our [Violent and Hateful Entitites policy](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/violent-entities.html). We do not require that a person have been confirmed as members of terrorist organizations or other violent and hateful entities, nor that they have any official affiliation with any group, organization, or ideology, for us to enforce on content under this aspect of our policies.

Suicide and Self-harm policy
============================

Overview  
 

**You may not promote or encourage suicide or self-harm.**

At X, we recognize that suicide and self-harm are significant social & public health challenges that require collaboration between all stakeholders – public, private, and civil society – and that we have a role and responsibility to help people access and receive support when they need it.  

When developing this policy, we consulted extensively with experts to ensure that people who have engaged in self-harm or experienced suicidal thoughts can share their personal experiences. We also recognized the need to protect people from the potential harm caused by exposure to content that could promote or encourage self-harm – intentionally or inadvertently. That’s why our policy prohibits content that promotes or encourages self-harming behaviors and provides support to those undergoing experiences with self-harm or suicidal thoughts.  
 

### What is in violation of this policy? 

Under this policy, you can’t promote, or otherwise encourage, suicide or self-harm. We define promotion and encouragement to include statements such as “the most effective”, “the easiest”, “the best”, “the most successful”, “you should”, “why don’t you”. Violations of this policy can occur via Posts, images or videos, including live video. 

We define suicide to be the act of taking one’s own life. We define self-harm to include:

* self-inflicted physical injuries e.g., cutting; and
    
* eating disorders e.g., bulimia, anorexia.  
     
    

Violations of this policy include, but are not limited to:  

* encouraging someone to physically harm or kill themselves;
    
* asking others for encouragement to engage in self-harm or suicide, including seeking partners for group suicides or suicide games; and
    
* sharing information, strategies, methods or instructions that would assist people to engage in self-harm and suicide.  
     

### What is not a violation of this policy? 

Some examples of behavior that are not considered a violation of this policy include: 

* sharing personal stories and experiences related to self-harm or suicide;
    
* sharing coping mechanisms and resources for addressing self-harm or suicidal thoughts; and
    
* discussions that are focused on research, advocacy, and education related to self-harm or suicide prevention.  
     
    

**Note**: people can share their personal experiences, but should avoid sharing detailed information about specific strategies or methods related to self-harm, as this could inadvertently encourage this behavior.  
 

### Who can report violations of this policy? 

Anyone can report content that may encourage or promote suicide or self-harm via our in-app reporting or our [specialized reporting form](https://help.twitter.com/forms/suicide). These reports are routed to a dedicated team who evaluate each case individually. 

Note: if we receive a report that someone has expressed an intention to engage in self-harm or suicide, we will contact them directly, encourage them to seek support, and provide information about dedicated online and hotline resources. We may also work with law enforcement officials where appropriate, for example, if we receive a valid emergency disclosure request as defined in our [Law Enforcement Guidelines](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-law-enforcement-support).  
 

### How to report violations of this policy 

To ensure that we handle reports sensitively, our in-app reporting provides separate options for people who may be expressing an intention to harm themselves, and content that is encouraging or promoting self-harm or suicide.

If you violate this policy by sharing content that intentionally encourages others to harm themselves, ask others to encourage you to harm yourself, or share detailed information or instructions related to self-harm or suicide methods, we will require you to remove this content. We will also temporarily lock you out of your account before you can Post again. If you continue to violate this policy, or if your account is dedicated to promoting or encouraging self-harm or suicide, your account will be permanently suspended. If cases include images or videos related to self-harm or suicide, we will also evaluate this content under [our sensitive media policy](https://help.twitter.com/rules-and-policies/media-policy). If you believe that your account was suspended in error, [you can submit an appeal](https://help.twitter.com/forms/general?subtopic=suspended).  

We may also take steps to prevent the spread of instructional material hosted on third-party websites by [marking such links as unsafe](https://help.twitter.com/en/safety-and-security/phishing-spam-and-malware-links).

Sensitive Media
===============

### Overview

**January 2024**

**You may post content that falls under our definitions of Graphic Content, Adult Nudity, and Sexual Behavior with a content warning, but you may not share this media in a live video, or in your profile picture or header, List banner, or Community cover photo. Media depicting Gratutitous Gore, Violent Sexual Conduct, or Bestiality and Necrophilia is not permitted.**

People use X to show what’s happening in the world, often sharing images and videos as part of the conversation. Sometimes, this media can depict sensitive topics, including graphic content, adult nudity, and sexual behavior. We recognize that some people may not want to be exposed to sensitive content, which is why we balance allowing people to share this type of media with helping people who want to avoid it to do so. 

For this reason, you can’t include graphic content, adult nudity, or sexual behavior within areas that are highly visible on X, including in live video, your profile picture or header, List banners, or Community cover photos. If you share this content on X, you need to [mark](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/media-settings.html) your media or your account as sensitive. Doing so places images and videos behind a content warning that needs to be acknowledged before your media can be viewed. Using this feature means that people who don’t want to see sensitive media can avoid it, or make an informed decision before they choose to view it. We also restrict graphic media, adult nudity, and sexual behavior for viewers who are under 18 or viewers who do not include a birth date on their profile. Learn more about age restricted content [here](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/notices-on-twitter.html). Beginning January 2024, you may begin to see new media content warnings on posts that X has designated as Graphic (containing violent or hateful imagery) or containing Adult media (adult nudity and sexual behavior). When these new content warnings are available for you to use, please be sure to continue marking your sensitive media accordingly.

Under this policy, there are also some types of sensitive media that we don’t allow at all, because they have the potential to normalize violence and cause distress to those who view them. 

We group sensitive media content into the following categories: 

**  
Graphic Content**

Graphic Content is any media that depicts death, violence, medical procedures, or serious physical injury in graphic detail. Some examples include, but are not limited to, depictions of:

* violent crimes or accidents; 
* physical fights;
* physical child abuse;
* bodily fluids including blood, feces, semen etc.;
* serious physical harm, including visible wounds; and
* severely injured or mutilated animals.   
     

**Note:** exceptions may be made for documentary or educational content.   
  

**Adult Nudity and Sexual Behavior**

Adult Nudity and Sexual Behavior is any consensually produced and distributed media that is pornographic or intended to cause sexual arousal. Some examples include, but are not limited to, depictions of:

* full or partial nudity, including close-ups of genitals, buttocks, or breasts (excluding content related to breastfeeding);
* simulated sexual acts; and
* sexual intercourse or other sexual acts – this also applies to cartoons, hentai, or anime involving humans or depictions of animals with human-like features.  
     

**Note:** exceptions may be made for artistic, medical, health, or educational content.   
  

For content that was created or distributed without the consent of those featured, please refer to our [non-consensual nudity policy](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/intimate-media.html).   
  

**Violent Sexual Conduct**

Violent Sexual Conduct is any media that depicts violence, whether real or simulated, in association with sexual acts. Some examples include, but are not limited to, depictions of:

* rape and other forms of violent sexual assault, or sexual acts that occur without the consent of participants, including a simulated lack of consent; and
* sexualized violence – inflicting physical harm on an individual within an intimate setting, where it is not immediately obvious if those involved have consented to take part.  
     

**Bestiality and Necrophilia**

Bestiality is any media that depicts sexual acts between a human and an animal. Necrophilia is any media that depicts sexuals acts between a living human and a human corpse.

**Gratuitous Gore**

Gratuitous Gore is any media that depicts excessively graphic or gruesome content related to death, violence or severe physical harm, or graphic content that is shared for sadistic purposes. Some examples include, but are not limited to, depictions of:

* dismembered or mutilated humans;
* charred or burned human remains;
* exposed internal organs or bones; and
* animal torture or killing. 

**Note:** exceptions may be made for religious sacrifice, food preparation or processing, and hunting. 

**For deceased individuals, please refer to our [Deceased individuals policy](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/contact-twitter-about-media-on-a-deceased-family-members-account.html).**

### What is in violation of this policy?

  
Our aim is to limit exposure to sensitive images and videos and to prevent the sharing of potentially disturbing types of sensitive media. For this reason, we differentiate our enforcement approach depending on the type of media that has been shared and where it has been shared.   
 

**Graphic Content, Adult Nudity, and Sexual Behavior**  

* you can’t target people with unsolicited images or videos that contain Graphic Content, Adult Nudity, and Sexual Behavior
* you can’t include Graphic Content, Adult Nudity, or Sexual Behavior within live video, or in your profile picture or header, List banners, or Community cover photos.  
     

**Violent Sexual Conduct, Bestiality and Necrophilia, and Gratuitous Gore**

We strictly prohibit sharing Violent Sexual Conduct and Bestiality and Necrophilia to prevent the normalization of sexual assault and non-consensual violence associated with sexual acts. We also prohibit Gratuitous Gore content because research has shown that repeated exposure to excessively graphic content online may negatively impact an individual’s wellbeing. 

**Note:** very limited exceptions may be made for gory media associated with newsworthy events. 

### What is not a violation of this policy?

  
You can share Graphic Content, Adult Nudity, and Sexual Behavior within your posts, provided that you mark this media with a content warning.

You can adjust your media settings if you intend to regularly post this content, or add one-time content warnings to individual posts. Learn more [here](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/media-settings). If you don’t mark your media as sensitive, we will do so manually if your content is reported for review.  We may also limit exposure of posts depicting Graphic Content, Adult Nudity, and Sexual Behavior.

### Who can report violations of this policy?

  
Anyone can report potential violations of this policy via our dedicated [reporting flows](https://help.twitter.com/en/safety-and-security/report-a-post). 

### What happens if you violate this policy?

  
The enforcement action we take depends on the type of media you have shared, and where you have shared it.   
 

**Graphic Content, Adult Nudity, and Sexual Behavior**

* if shared in a live video, or in your profile picture or header, List banner, or Community cover photo - we will require you to remove this content
    
* if you target someone with this content, we'll require you to remove it under our [Abuse & Harassment policy](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/abusive-behavior.html)
    
* we may limit exposure of posts depicting this content
    

**Violent Sexual Conduct, Bestiality and Necrophilia**

* sharing these kinds of media anywhere on X is strictly prohibited. For the first time you violate this policy, we will require you to remove this content. If you violate this policy again after your first warning, your account may be permanently suspended
    
* your account may be permanently suspended if the majority of your activity on X is sharing this type of media.
    

 **Gratuitous Gore**

* if shared in a post, we will require you to remove this content
    
* if shared in a live video, or in your profile picture or header, List banner, or Community cover photo – the first time you violate this policy, we will require you to remove this content. If you violate this policy again after your first warning, your account may be permanently suspended
    
* your account may be permanently suspended if the majority of your activity on X is sharing this type of media.
    

If you believe that your account was suspended in error, you can [submit an appeal](https://help.twitter.com/forms/general?subtopic=suspended).

**You may not use our service for any unlawful purpose or in furtherance of illegal activities. This includes selling, buying, or facilitating transactions in illegal goods or services, as well as certain types of regulated goods or services.**  

X takes the safety of our users seriously. In an effort to address the potential for real-world harm, we do not allow the use of X for any unlawful behavior or to further illegal activities.

Private information and media policy
====================================

### Overview 

**December 2022**

**You may not publish or post other people's private information without their express authorization and permission. We also prohibit threatening to expose private information or incentivizing others to do so.**

**In addition, you may not share private media, such as images or videos of private individuals, without their consent. However, we recognise that there are instances where users may share images or videos of private individuals, who are not public figures, as part of a newsworthy event or to further public discourse on issues or events of public interest. In such cases, we may allow the media to remain on the platform.** 

**Sharing someone’s private information:**

Sharing someone’s private information online without their permission, sometimes called doxxing, is a breach of their privacy and of the [X Rules](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-rules.html). Sharing private information can pose serious safety and security risks for those affected and can lead to physical, emotional, and financial hardship.  

When reviewing reports under this policy, we consider a number of things, including:  
  

**What type of information is being shared?  
**  
We take this into consideration because certain types of private or live information carry higher risks than others, if they’re shared without permission. Our primary aim is to protect individuals from potential physical harm as a result of their information being shared, so we consider information such as physical location and phone numbers to be a higher risk than other types of information. We define “live” as real-time and/or same-day information where there is potential that the individual could still be at the named location.  

**Who is sharing the information?**  
  
We also consider who is sharing the reported information and whether or not they have the consent of the person it belongs to. We do this because we know that there are times when people may want some forms of their personal information to be shared publicly. For example, sharing a personal phone number or email for professional networking or to coordinate social events or publicly sharing someone’s home addresses or live locations to seek help after a natural disaster.   
 

**Is the information available elsewhere online?  
**  
If the reported information was shared somewhere else before it was shared on X, e.g., someone sharing their personal phone number on their own publicly accessible website, we may not treat this information as private, as the owner has made it publicly available. Note: we may take action against home addresses being shared, even if they are publicly available, due to the potential for physical harm.   
 

**Why is the information being shared?  
**  
We also factor in the intent of the person sharing the information. For example, if we believe that someone is sharing information with an abusive intent, or to harass or encourage others to harass another person, we will take action. On the other hand, if someone is sharing information in an effort to help someone involved in a crisis situation like in the aftermath of a violent event, we may not take action. Note: regardless of intent, if the information is not shared during a crisis situation to assist with humanitarian efforts or in relation to public engagement events, we will remove any posts or accounts that share someone’s live location.

**  
Sharing private media:**

Posting images is an important part of our users' experience on X. Where individuals have a reasonable expectation of privacy in an individual piece of media, we believe they should be able to determine whether or not it is shared. Sharing such media could potentially violate users' privacy and may lead to emotional or physical harm. When we are notified by individuals depicted, or their authorized representative, that they did not consent to having media shared, we will remove the media. This policy is not applicable to public figures. 

### What is in violation of this policy? 

Under this policy, you can’t share the following types of private information, without the permission of the person who it belongs to:

* home address or physical location information, including street addresses, GPS coordinates or other identifying information related to locations that are considered private;
* live location information, including information shared on X directly or links to 3rd-party URL(s) of travel routes, actual physical location, or other identifying information that would reveal a person’s location, regardless if this information is publicly available;
* identity documents, including government-issued IDs and social security or other national identity numbers – note: we may make limited exceptions in regions where this information is not considered to be private;
* contact information, including non-public personal phone numbers or email addresses; 
* financial account information, including bank account and credit card details;
* other private information, including biometric data or medical records;
* media of private individuals without the permission of the person(s) depicted; and
* media depicting prisoners of war posted by government or state-affiliated media accounts on or after April 5, 2022. 

The following behaviors are also not permitted:   

* threatening to publicly expose someone’s private information;
* sharing information that would enable individuals to hack or gain access to someone’s private information without their consent,e.g., sharing sign-in credentials for online banking services;
* asking for or offering a bounty or financial reward in exchange for posting someone’s private information;
* asking for a bounty or financial reward in exchange for not posting someone’s private information, sometimes referred to as blackmail.  
     

### What is not a violation of this policy? 

The following are not in violation of this policy:

* people sharing their own private information;
* sharing publicly available location information after a reasonable time has elapsed, so that the individual is no longer at risk for physical harm
* sharing information that is publicly available elsewhere, in a non-abusive manner (with the exception of live location information); and
* sharing information that we don’t consider to be private, including:
    * name;
    * birthdate or age;
    * place of education or employment;
    * location information related to commercial property or places of business, where this information is publicly available;
    * descriptions of physical appearance;
    * gossip, rumours, accusations, and allegations; and
    * screenshots of text messages or messages from other platforms (unless they contain private information e.g., phone number).  
         

**For media, the following are not in violation of our policy:**

* the media is publicly available or is being covered by mainstream media;
* the media and the accompanying post text add value to the public discourse or are shared in public interest;
* contains eyewitness accounts or on the ground reports from developing events; 
* the subject of the media is a public figure. 

### Who can report violations of this policy? 

**Sharing private information:**

Anyone can report private information that has been shared in a clearly abusive way (whether they have a X account or not). In cases where the information hasn’t been shared with a clearly abusive intent, we need to hear directly from the owner of this information (or an authorized representative, such as a lawyer) before taking enforcement action. 

  
**Sharing private media:** 

When reporting private media, we need a first person report in order to make the determination that the image or video has been shared without their permission. We accept reports from: 

1. Individuals depicted in the reported media or
2. Their authorized representative such as:  
        a.  parents/legal guardians,  
        b.  lawyers, or  
        c.  legal representative.

Non-consensual nudity policy
============================

[Take the survey](https://www.research.net/r/QFBQSNC)

### Overview

**  
December 2021**

**You may not post or share intimate photos or videos of someone that were produced or distributed without their consent.**

Sharing explicit sexual images or videos of someone online without their consent is a severe violation of their privacy and the [X Rules](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-rules.html). Sometimes referred to as revenge porn, this content poses serious safety and security risks for people affected and can lead to physical, emotional, and financial hardship.  
  

### What is a violation of this policy?

  
Under this policy, you can’t post or share explicit images or videos that were taken, appear to have been taken or that were shared without the consent of the people involved.

Examples of the types of content that violate this policy include, but are not limited to:  

* hidden camera content featuring nudity, partial nudity, and/or sexual acts;
* creepshots or upskirts - images or videos taken of people’s buttocks, up an individual’s skirt/dress or other clothes that allows people to see the person’s genitals, buttocks, or breasts; 
* images or videos that superimpose or otherwise digitally manipulate an individual’s face onto another person’s nude body; 
* images or videos that are taken in an intimate setting and not intended for public distribution; and
* offering a bounty or financial reward in exchange for intimate images or videos.  
     

### What is not a violation of this policy?

  
Pornography and other forms of consensually produced adult content are allowed on X, provided that this media is marked as sensitive. Doing so provides people who may not want to see this type of content with a warning that they will need to acknowledge before viewing your media. 

To mark your media as sensitive, navigate to your [safety settings](https://twitter.com/settings/safety) and select the **Mark media you post as containing material that may be sensitive** option. If you don’t mark your media as sensitive, we may do so manually if your content is reported for review.   
  

### Who can report violations of this policy?

  
Because X allows some types of adult content, we need to evaluate context to assess if reported content has been created or shared without the consent of those involved.   
 

**Content reportable by anyone**

We recognize that it can be difficult for those impacted to report this type of content for review. To reduce the burden on those affected, anyone can report the following types of content:

* creepshots or upskirts;
* content where a bounty or financial reward is offered in exchange for non-consensual nudity media; and
* intimate images or videos that are accompanied by:
* text that wishes/hopes for harm to come to those depicted or otherwise refers to revenge e.g., “I hope you get what you deserve when people see this”; and
* information that could be used to contact those depicted e.g., “You can tell my ex what you think by calling them on 1234567”.  
     

**Content reportable by featured individual(s)**

For other types of content, we may need to hear directly from the individual(s) featured (or an authorized representative, such as a lawyer) to ensure that we have sufficient context before taking any enforcement action.   
 

### How can I report violations of this policy?

**  
In-app**

You can report this content for review in-app as follows:

### What happens if you violate this policy?

  
We will **immediately and permanently suspend any account that we identify as the original poster of intimate media** that was created or shared without consent. We will do the same with any account that posts only this type of content, e.g., accounts dedicated to sharing upskirt images.

In other cases, we may not suspend an account immediately. This is because some people share this content inadvertently, to express shock, disbelief or to denounce this practice. In these cases, we will require you to remove this content. We will also temporarily lock you out of your account before you can post again. If you violate this policy again after your first warning, your account will be permanently suspended. If you believe that your account was suspended in error, you can [submit an appeal](https://help.twitter.com/en/forms/account-access/appeals.html).

Platform manipulation and spam policy
=====================================

### Overview

**  
March 2023**

**You may not use X's services in a manner intended to artificially amplify or suppress information or engage in behavior that manipulates or disrupts people’s experience or platform manipulation defenses on X.**

We want X to be a place where people can make human connections, find reliable information, and express themselves freely and safely. To make that possible, we do not allow spam or other types of platform manipulation. We define platform manipulation as using X to engage in bulk, aggressive, or deceptive activity that misleads others and/or disrupts their experience.  

Platform manipulation can take many forms and our rules are intended to address a wide range of prohibited behavior, including:  

* commercially-motivated spam, that typically aims to drive traffic or attention from a conversation on X to accounts, websites, products, services, or initiatives;
* inauthentic engagements, that attempt to make accounts or content appear more popular or active than they are;
* coordinated activity, that attempts to artificially influence conversations through the use of multiple accounts, fake accounts, automation and/or scripting;
* coordinated harmful activity that encourages or promotes behavior which violates [Our Rules](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-rules.html); and
* leveraging X's open source code to circumvent remediations or platform defenses.

Civic integrity policy
======================

### Overview

### **August 2023**

**You may not use X’s services for the purpose of manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes, such as posting or sharing content that may suppress participation, mislead people about when, where, or how to participate in a civic process, or lead to offline violence during an election.** Any attempt to undermine the integrity of civic participation undermines our core tenets of freedom of expression and as a result, we will apply labels to violative posts informing users that the content is misleading.

**What is a civic process?** 

X considers civic processes to be events or procedures mandated, organized, and conducted by the governing and/or electoral body of a country, state, region, district, or municipality to address a matter of common concern through public participation. Some examples of civic processes may include: 

* Political elections
* Censuses 
* Major referenda and ballot initiatives   
     

**What is in violation of this policy?**

This policy addresses 4 categories of misleading behavior and content: 

**Misleading information about how to participate**

You may not advance verifiably false or misleading information about how to participate in an election or other civic process. This includes but is not limited to:

* misleading information about procedures to participate in a civic process (for example, that you can vote by Post, text message, email, or phone call in jurisdictions where these are not a possibility);
* misleading information about requirements for participation, including identification or citizenship requirements;
* misleading claims that cause confusion about the established laws, regulations, procedures, and methods of a civic process, or about the actions of officials or entities executing those civic processes; and
* misleading statements or information about the official, announced date or time of a civic process.

**Suppression**

You may not advance verifiably false or misleading information about the circumstances surrounding a civic process intended to intimidate or dissuade people from participating in an election or other civic process. This includes but is not limited to:

* misleading claims that polling places are closed, that polling has ended, or other misleading information relating to votes not being counted; 
    
* misleading claims about police or law enforcement activity related to voting in an election, polling places, or collecting census information; 
    
* misleading claims about long lines, equipment problems, or other disruptions at voting locations during election periods;
    

**Intimidation**

You may not engage in or promote behaviors that may coerce others to refrain from participating in a civic process. This includes, but is not limited to:

* inciting or promoting violent behaviors intentionally near a location where an electoral process is being conducted, including polling stations and vote counting locations;

Misleading and deceptive identities policy
==========================================

Overview
--------

April 2023
==========

**You may not misappropriate the identity of individuals, groups, or organizations or use a fake identity to deceive others.**
==============================================================================================================================

We want X to be a place where people can find authentic voices. While you are not required to display your real name or image on your profile, your account should not use false profile information to represent itself as a person or entity that is not affiliated with the account owner, such that it may mislead others who use X.

Synthetic and manipulated media policy
======================================

### Overview 

### April 2023

**You may not share synthetic, manipulated, or out-of-context media that may deceive or confuse people and lead to harm (“misleading media”). In addition, we may label posts containing misleading media to help people understand their authenticity and to provide additional context.**

Trademark policy
================

### Overview

### **April 2023**

**  
You may not violate others’ intellectual property rights, including copyright and trademark.**

A trademark is a word, logo, phrase, or device that distinguishes a trademark holder’s good or service in the marketplace. Trademark law may prevent others from using a trademark in an unauthorized or confusing manner.    
  

### What is in violation of this policy? 

Using another’s trademark in a way that may mislead or confuse people about your affiliation may be a violation of our trademark policy.  
 

### What is not a violation of this policy? 

Referencing another’s trademark is not automatically a violation of X's trademark policy. Examples of non-violations include:

* using a trademark in a way that is outside the scope of the trademark registration e.g., in a different territory, or a different class of goods or services than that identified in the registration; and
* using a trademark in a nominative or other fair use manner. For more information, see our [Misleading and deceptive identities policy](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-impersonation-and-deceptive-identities-policy.html).[](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-impersonation-and-deceptive-identities-policy.html)

Copyright policy
================

#### What types of copyright complaints does X respond to?

X responds to copyright complaints submitted under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”). Section 512 of the DMCA outlines the statutory requirements necessary for formally reporting copyright infringement, as well as providing instructions on how an affected party can appeal a removal by submitting a compliant counter-notice.

X will respond to reports of alleged copyright infringement, such as allegations concerning the unauthorized use of a copyrighted image as a profile or header photo, allegations concerning the unauthorized use of a copyrighted video or image uploaded through our media hosting services, or posts containing links to allegedly infringing materials. Note that not all unauthorized uses of copyrighted materials are infringements (see our [fair use](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/fair-use-policy.html) article for more information).

If you are concerned about the use of your brand or entity’s name, please review [Twitter’s trademark policy](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-trademark-policy.html). If you are concerned about a parody, newsfeed, commentary, or fan account, please see the relevant policy [here](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/parody-account-policy.html). These are generally not copyright issues.

#### Am I a copyright holder? How do I know?

If you are unsure whether you hold rights to a particular work, please consult an attorney or another adviser as X cannot provide legal advice. There are plenty of resources to learn more about copyright law including [http://copyright.gov](http://copyright.gov/) and [http://www.eff.org/issues/bloggers/legal/liability/IP](http://www.eff.org/issues/bloggers/legal/liability/IP), just to name a few.

#### What to consider before submitting a copyright complaint

Before submitting a copyright complaint to us, please consider whether or not the use could be considered [fair use](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/fair-use-policy.html). 

If you have considered fair use, and you still wish to continue with a copyright complaint, you may want to first reach out to the user in question to see if you can resolve the matter directly with the user. You can reply to the user’s post or send the user a Direct Message and ask for them to remove your copyrighted content without having to contact X. 

Prior to submitting a formal complaint with X, please be aware that under 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), you may be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred by us or our users, if you knowingly materially misrepresent that material or activity is infringing. If you are unsure whether the material you are reporting is in fact infringing, you may wish to contact an attorney before filing a notification with us.

Note: In general, the photographer and NOT the subject of a photograph is the actual rights holder of the resulting photograph. If you’re unsure whether or not you own the copyrights to a work, or if you’re infringing upon someone else’s work, please consult an attorney or another advisor.

#### What information do you need to process a copyright complaint?

To submit a notice of claimed copyright infringement, you will need to provide us with the following information:

1. A physical or electronic signature (typing your full name will suffice) of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf;
2. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (e.g., a link to your original work or clear description of the materials allegedly being infringed upon);
3. Identification of the infringing material and information reasonably sufficient to permit X to locate the material on our website or services;
4. Your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address;
5. A statement that you have a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner asserted is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
6. A statement that the information in the complaint is accurate, and, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.  
     

If you are reporting the content of a post, please give us a [direct link](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/tweet-and-moment-url.html) to that post. Or please specify if the alleged infringement is in the header, avatar, etc. A LINK TO A PROFILE PAGE IS INSUFFICIENT FOR X TO IDENTIFY INFRINGING MATERIALS.

#### How do I file a copyright complaint?

You can report alleged copyright infringement by visiting X Help Center and [filing a copyright complaint](https://help.twitter.com/forms/ipi). If you are logged in to x.com, you can visit the X Help Center directly from your X account by clicking the ‘Help’ link located in the sidebar.

Filing a DMCA complaint is the start of a pre-defined legal process. Your complaint will be reviewed for accuracy, validity, and completeness. If your complaint has satisfied these requirements, we will take action on your request - which includes forwarding a full copy of your notice (including your name, address, phone and email address) to the user(s) who posted the allegedly infringing material in question.

If you are concerned about your contact information being forwarded, you may wish to use an agent to report for you.

Please be aware that under 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), you may be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred by us or our users, if you knowingly materially misrepresent that material or activity is infringing. If you are unsure whether the material you are reporting is in fact infringing, you may wish to contact an attorney before filing a copyright complaint.

#### How are claims processed?

We process copyright complaints in the order in which they are received. Once you've submitted your ticket, we will email you a ticket confirmation. If you do not receive a ticket confirmation that means we did not receive your complaint and you should re-submit your complaint. However, please note, submitting duplicate copyright complaints will result in a delay in processing.

If we decide to remove or disable access to the material, we will notify the affected user(s) and provide them with a full copy of the reporter’s complaint (including the provided contact information) along with instructions on how to file a counter-notice.

#### What information gets forwarded to the reported user(s)?

If we remove or disable access to the materials reported in a copyright complaint, the reported user(s) will receive a copy of the complaint, including the reporter’s full name, email, street address, and any other information included in the complaint. 

If you are uncomfortable sharing your contact information with the reported user(s), you may wish to consider appointing an agent to submit your DMCA notice on your behalf. Your agent will be required to submit the DMCA notice with valid contact information, and identify you as the content owner that they are representing. 

#### What happens next?

X's response to copyright complaints may include the removal or restriction of access to allegedly infringing material. If we remove or restrict access to user content in response to a copyright complaint, X will make a good faith effort to contact the affected account holder with information concerning the removal or restriction of access, including a full copy of the complaint, along with instructions for filing a counter-notice.

If you’ve not yet received a copy of the copyright complaint regarding the content removed from your account, please respond to the support ticket we sent you.

In an effort to be as transparent as possible regarding the removal or restriction of access to user-posted content, we clearly mark withheld posts and media to indicate to viewers when content has been withheld (examples below).

  ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22 viewBox=%220 0 530 86%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

  ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22 viewBox=%220 0 350 161%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

#### Why did I receive a copyright complaint?

If you receive a copyright complaint, it means that access to the content described in the complaint has been restricted. Please take the time to read through our correspondence to you, which includes information on the complaint we received as well as instructions on how to file a counter-notice. Please ensure that you are monitoring the email address associated with your X account.

Tip: Removing the material reported in a copyright complaint will not resolve that complaint

#### What if I want to contest the takedown?

If you believe that the materials reported in the copyright complaints  
were misidentified or removed in error, you may send us a [counter-notification(s)](https://help.twitter.com/en/forms/ipi/dmca-counternotice.html) through our Help Center. A counter-notice is a request for X to reinstate the removed material, and it has legal consequences. Alternatively, you may be able to seek a retraction of the copyright complaint from the reporter.

#### How do I seek a retraction?

The DMCA complaint you received includes the contact information of the reporter. You may want to reach out and ask them to retract their notice using our [retraction form](https://help.twitter.com/forms/ipi/dmca-retraction). This is the fastest and most efficient means of resolving an unresolved copyright complaint. Alternatively, the reporter can also send a retraction notice to [copyright@twitter.com](mailto:copyright@twitter.com).  Such notice should include: (1) identification of the material that was disabled, and (2) a statement that the reporter would like to retract their DMCA notice.  A retraction is at the sole discretion of the original reporter, and only that reporter can issue a retraction.  If a portion of your post has been withheld, the violation will not be resolved just by deleting the remaining portion.

#### When should I file a counter-notice?

A counter-notice is a request for X to reinstate the removed material, and is the start of a legal process that has legal consequences.  For example, submitting a counter notice indicates that you consent to the jurisdiction of a U.S. Federal court and that you consent to the disclosure of your personal information to the reporter.

With these considerations in mind, you may file a counter-notice if you believe that this material was misidentified, or you have a good faith belief that the material should not have been removed.  If you’re unsure whether or not you should file a counter-notice, you may want to consult with an attorney.

Tip: Re-posting material removed in response to a copyright complaint may result in permanent account suspension. If you believe the content was removed in error, please file a counter-notice rather than re-posting the material. 

#### What information do you need to process a counter-notice?

To submit a counter-notice, you will need to provide us with the following information:

1. A physical or electronic signature (typing your full name will suffice);
2. Your full name, address (including country), telephone number, and for verification purposes, your X username and associated email;
3. Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled, and the location at which the material appeared before that removal or disabling (the description from the copyright notice will suffice);
4. A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and
5. One of the following jurisdictional consent statements:

(If your address is in the United States) 

“I consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located and I’ll accept service of process from the person who provided notice under 17 U.S.C. 512 (c)(1)(C) or an agent of such person.”

OR

(If your address is outside of the United States) 

"I consent to any judicial district in which X may be found, and I’ll accept service of process from the person who provided notice under 17 U.S.C. 512 (c)(1)(C) or an agent of such person."

To submit a counter-notice, please provide all of the above information using our web form, located [here](https://help.twitter.com/forms/ipi/dmca-counternotice.html).

#### What happens after I submit a counter-notice?

Upon receipt of a valid counter-notice, we will promptly forward a copy to the person who filed the original notice. This means that the contact information that is submitted in your counter-notice will be shared to the person who filed the original notice. 

If the copyright owner disagrees that the content was removed in error or misidentification, they may pursue legal action against you.  If we do not receive notice within 10 business days that the original reporter is seeking a court order to prevent further infringement of the material at issue, we may replace or cease disabling access to the material that was removed.

We cannot offer any legal advice. Should you have questions, please consult an attorney.

#### Filing a copyright complaint or counter-notice is serious business!

Please think twice before submitting a claim or counter-notice, especially if you are unsure whether you are the actual rights holder or authorized to act on a rights holder’s behalf. There are legal and financial consequences for fraudulent and/or bad faith submissions. Please be sure that you are the actual rights holder, or that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed in error, and that you understand the repercussions of submitting a false claim.

#### What happens if my account receives one or more copyright complaints?

If multiple copyright complaints are received about an account, or other evidence suggests a pattern of repeat infringement, X may suspend that account in accordance with our Repeat Infringer Policy. Our Repeat Infringer Policy takes valid retractions and counter-notices into account. Users suspended under that policy may file a suspension appeal using [this form](https://help.twitter.com/forms/general?subtopic=suspended).

Additionally, re-posting material that was already removed in response to a copyright complaint, indicating where to access copyrighted material on third party websites, or certain other actions that demonstrate your account is intended solely or primarily to infringe the copyrighted material of others may result in permanent account suspension. If you are suspended on this basis, you may file an appeal using [this form](https://help.twitter.com/forms/general?subtopic=suspended). Please be aware that appealing a suspension does not guarantee your account will be reinstated.

Our approach to policy development and enforcement philosophy
=============================================================

X is reflective of real conversations happening in the world and that sometimes includes perspectives that may be offensive, controversial, and/or bigoted to others. While we welcome everyone to express themselves on our service, we will not tolerate behavior that harasses, threatens, or uses fear to silence the voices of others.

We have the [X Rules](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-rules.html) in place to help ensure everyone feels safe expressing their beliefs and we strive to enforce them with uniform consistency. Learn more about [different enforcement actions](https://support.twitter.com/articles/20175435).
