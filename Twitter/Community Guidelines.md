The Twitter Rules
=================

Twitter's purpose is to serve the public conversation. Violence, harassment and other similar types of behavior discourage people from expressing themselves, and ultimately diminish the value of global public conversation. Our rules are to ensure all people can participate in the public conversation freely and safely.  
 

### Safety

  
Violence: You may not threaten violence against an individual or a group of people. We also prohibit the glorification of violence.

Suicide and Self-harm policy
============================

Overview  
 

**You may not promote or encourage suicide or self-harm.**

At Twitter, we recognize that suicide and self-harm are significant social & public health challenges that require collaboration between all stakeholders – public, private, and civil society – and that we have a role and responsibility to help people access and receive support when they need it.  

When developing this policy, we consulted extensively with experts to ensure that people who have engaged in self-harm or experienced suicidal thoughts can share their personal experiences. We also recognized the need to protect people from the potential harm caused by exposure to content that could promote or encourage self-harm – intentionally or inadvertently. That’s why our policy prohibits content that promotes or encourages self-harming behaviors and provides support to those undergoing experiences with self-harm or suicidal thoughts.  
 

### What is in violation of this policy? 

Under this policy, you can’t promote, or otherwise encourage, suicide or self-harm. We define promotion and encouragement to include statements such as “the most effective”, “the easiest”, “the best”, “the most successful”, “you should”, “why don’t you”. Violations of this policy can occur via Tweets, images or videos, including live video. 

We define suicide to be the act of taking one’s own life. We define self-harm to include:

* self-inflicted physical injuries e.g., cutting; and
    
* eating disorders e.g., bulimia, anorexia.  
     
    

Violations of this policy include, but are not limited to:  

* encouraging someone to physically harm or kill themselves;
    
* asking others for encouragement to engage in self-harm or suicide, including seeking partners for group suicides or suicide games; and
    
* sharing information, strategies, methods or instructions that would assist people to engage in self-harm and suicide.  
     

### What is not a violation of this policy? 

Some examples of behavior that are not considered a violation of this policy include: 

* sharing personal stories and experiences related to self-harm or suicide;
    
* sharing coping mechanisms and resources for addressing self-harm or suicidal thoughts; and
    
* discussions that are focused on research, advocacy, and education related to self-harm or suicide prevention.  
     
    

**Note**: people can share their personal experiences, but should avoid sharing detailed information about specific strategies or methods related to self-harm, as this could inadvertently encourage this behavior.  
 

### Who can report violations of this policy? 

Anyone can report content that may encourage or promote suicide or self-harm via our in-app reporting or our [specialized reporting form](https://help.twitter.com/forms/suicide). These reports are routed to a dedicated team who evaluate each case individually. 

Note: if we receive a report that someone has expressed an intention to engage in self-harm or suicide, we will contact them directly, encourage them to seek support, and provide information about dedicated online and hotline resources. We may also work with law enforcement officials where appropriate, for example, if we receive a valid emergency disclosure request as defined in our [Law Enforcement Guidelines](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-law-enforcement-support).  
 

### How to report violations of this policy 

To ensure that we handle reports sensitively, our in-app reporting provides separate options for people who may be expressing an intention to harm themselves, and content that is encouraging or promoting self-harm or suicide.

### What happens if you violate this policy? 

Our enforcement approach depends on the type of content being shared, whether or not the reported account is encouraging or promoting self-harm or suicide, and the account’s previous history of violations. 

If you violate this policy by sharing content that intentionally encourages others to harm themselves, ask others to encourage you to harm yourself, or share detailed information or instructions related to self-harm or suicide methods, we will require you to remove this content. We will also temporarily lock you out of your account before you can Tweet again. If you continue to violate this policy, or if your account is dedicated to promoting or encouraging self-harm or suicide, your account will be permanently suspended. If cases include images or videos related to self-harm or suicide, we will also evaluate this content under [our sensitive media policy](https://help.twitter.com/rules-and-policies/media-policy). If you believe that your account was suspended in error, [you can submit an appeal](https://help.twitter.com/forms/general?subtopic=suspended).  

We may also take steps to prevent the spread of instructional material hosted on third-party websites by [marking such links as unsafe](https://help.twitter.com/en/safety-and-security/phishing-spam-and-malware-links).

Hateful conduct policy
======================

**[Hateful conduct:](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-rules.html)**[](https://help.twitter.com/rules-and-policies/twitter-rules#hateful-conduct) You may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, caste, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease. We also do not allow accounts whose primary purpose is inciting harm towards others on the basis of these categories.

**Hateful imagery and display names:** You may not use hateful images or symbols in your profile image or profile header. You also may not use your username, display name, or profile bio to engage in abusive behavior, such as targeted harassment or expressing hate towards a person, group, or protected category.   
 

### Rationale 

Twitter’s mission is to give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information, and to express their opinions and beliefs without barriers. Free expression is a human right – we believe that everyone has a voice, and the right to use it. Our role is to serve the public conversation, which requires representation of a diverse range of perspectives. 

We recognize that if people experience abuse on Twitter, it can jeopardize their ability to express themselves. Research has shown that some groups of people are disproportionately targeted with abuse online. This includes; women, people of color, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual individuals, marginalized and historically underrepresented communities. For those who identify with multiple underrepresented groups, abuse may be more common, more severe in nature and more harmful.

We are committed to combating abuse motivated by hatred, prejudice or intolerance, particularly abuse that seeks to silence the voices of those who have been historically marginalized. For this reason, we prohibit behavior that targets individuals or groups with abuse based on their perceived membership in a protected category.  

If you see something on Twitter that you believe violates our hateful conduct policy, please [report it to us](https://help.twitter.com/en/forms/safety-and-sensitive-content/abuse.html).

### When this applies  

We will review and take action against reports of accounts targeting an individual or group of people with any of the following behavior, whether within Tweets or Direct Messages.   
 

**Violent threats  
  
**We prohibit content that makes violent threats against an identifiable target. Violent threats are declarative statements of intent to inflict injuries that would result in serious and lasting bodily harm, where an individual could die or be significantly injured, e.g., “I will kill you.”

**Note:** we have a zero tolerance policy against violent threats. Those deemed to be sharing violent threats will face immediate and permanent suspension of their account.   
 

**Wishing, hoping or calling for serious harm on a person or group of people  
  
**We prohibit content that wishes, hopes, promotes, incites, or expresses a desire for death, serious bodily harm, or serious disease against an entire protected category and/or individuals who may be members of that category. This includes, but is not limited to: 

* Hoping that an entire protected category and/or individuals who may be members of that category dies as a result of a serious disease, e.g., “I hope all \[nationality\] get COVID and die.”
* Wishing for someone to fall victim to a serious accident, e.g., “I wish that you would get run over by a car next time you run your mouth.”  
    
* Saying that a group of individuals deserve serious physical injury, e.g., “If this group of \[slur\] don’t shut up, they deserve to be shot.”
* Encouraging others to commit violence against an individual or a group based on their perceived membership in a protected category, e.g., “I’m in the mood to punch a \[racial slur\], who’s with me?”  
     

**References to mass murder, violent events, or specific means of violence where protected groups have been the primary targets or victims  
  
**We prohibit targeting individuals or groups with content that references forms of violence or violent events where a protected category was the primary target or victims, where the intent is to harass. This includes, but is not limited to media or text that refers to or depicts:

* genocides, (e.g., the Holocaust);
* lynchings.  
     

**Incitement against protected categories** 

We prohibit inciting behavior that targets individuals or groups of people belonging to protected categories. This includes content intended:

* to incite fear or spread fearful stereotypes about a protected category, including asserting that members of a protected category are more likely to take part in dangerous or illegal activities, e.g., “all \[religious group\] are terrorists.”
* to incite others to harass members of a protected category on or off platform, e.g., “I’m sick of these \[religious group\] thinking they are better than us, if any of you see someone wearing a \[religious symbol of the religious group\], grab it off them and post pics!“
* to incite others to discriminate in the form of denial of support to the economic enterprise of an individual or group because of their perceived membership in a protected category, e.g., “If you go to a \[religious group\] store, you are supporting those \[slur\], let’s stop giving our money to these \[religious slur\].” This may not include content intended as political in nature, such as political commentary or content relating to boycotts or protests.

Note that content intended to incite violence against a protected category is prohibited under **Wishing, hoping, or calling for serious harm on a person or groups of people.**

We prohibit targeting individuals and groups with content intended to incite fear or spread fearful stereotypes about a protected category, including asserting that members of a protected category are more likely to take part in dangerous or illegal activities, e.g., “all \[religious group\] are terrorists.”   
 

**Repeated and/or non-consensual slurs, epithets, racist and sexist tropes, or other content that degrades someone**  
  
We prohibit targeting others with repeated slurs, tropes or other content that intends to dehumanize, degrade or reinforce negative or harmful stereotypes about a protected category. This includes targeted misgendering or deadnaming of transgender individuals. We also prohibit the dehumanization of a group of people based on their religion, caste, age, disability, serious disease, national origin, race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, or sexual orientation. In some cases, such as (but not limited to) severe, repetitive usage of slurs, epithets, or racist/sexist tropes where the primary intent is to harass or intimidate others, we may require Tweet removal. In other cases, such as (but not limited to) moderate, isolated usage where the primary intent is to harass or intimidate others, we may limit Tweet visibility as further described below.  
 

**Hateful imagery  
**  

We consider hateful imagery to be logos, symbols, or images whose purpose is to promote hostility and malice against others based on their race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or ethnicity/national origin. Some examples of hateful imagery include, but are not limited to:

* symbols historically associated with hate groups, e.g., the Nazi swastika;
* images depicting others as less than human, or altered to include hateful symbols, e.g., altering images of individuals to include animalistic features; or
* images altered to include hateful symbols or references to a mass murder that targeted a protected category, e.g., manipulating images of individuals to include yellow Star of David badges, in reference to the Holocaust.

Media depicting hateful imagery is not permitted within live video, account bio, profile or header images. All other instances must be marked as sensitive media. Additionally, sending an individual unsolicited hateful imagery is a violation of our [abusive behavior policy](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/abusive-behavior.html).   
 

### Do I need to be the target of this content for it to be a violation of the Twitter Rules? 

Some Tweets may appear to be hateful when viewed in isolation, but may not be when viewed in the context of a larger conversation. For example, members of a protected category may refer to each other using terms that are typically considered as slurs. When used consensually, the intent behind these terms is not abusive, but a means to reclaim terms that were historically used to demean individuals.  

When we review this type of content, it may not be clear whether the intention is to abuse an individual on the basis of their protected status, or if it is part of a consensual conversation. To help our teams understand the context, we sometimes need to hear directly from the person being targeted to ensure that we have the information needed prior to taking any enforcement action.

**Note:** individuals do not need to be a member of a specific protected category for us to take action. We will never ask people to prove or disprove membership in any protected category and we will not investigate this information.   
 

### Consequences 

Under this policy, we take action against behavior that targets individuals or an entire protected category with hateful conduct, as described above. Targeting can happen in a number of ways, for example, mentions, including a photo of an individual, referring to someone by their full name, etc.

When determining the penalty for violating this policy, we consider a number of factors including, but not limited to the severity of the violation and an individual’s previous record of rule violations. The following is a list of potential enforcement options for content that violates this policy:

* Downranking Tweets in replies, except when the user follows the Tweet author.  
    
* Making Tweets ineligible for amplification in Top search results and/or on timelines for users who don’t follow the Tweet author.
* Excluding Tweets and/or accounts in email or in-product recommendations. 
* Requiring Tweet removal.
    * For example, we may ask someone to remove the violating content and serve a period of time in read-only mode before they can Tweet again. Subsequent violations will lead to longer read-only periods and may eventually result in permanent suspension.
* Suspending accounts whose primary use we’ve determined is to engage in hateful conduct as defined in this policy, or who have shared violent threats.

Learn more about our [range of enforcement options](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/enforcement-options.html). 

If someone believes their account was suspended in error, they can [submit an appeal](https://help.twitter.com/forms/general?subtopic=suspended).

Child sexual exploitation policy
================================

### Overview 

**October 2020**

**We have a zero-tolerance child sexual exploitation policy on Twitter.**

Twitter has **zero tolerance towards any material that features or promotes child sexual exploitation**, one of the most serious violations of the [Twitter Rules](https://help.twitter.com/rules-and-policies/twitter-rules). This may include media, text, illustrated, or computer-generated images. Regardless of the intent, viewing, sharing, or linking to child sexual exploitation material contributes to the re-victimization of the depicted children. This also applies to content that may further contribute to victimization of children through the promotion or glorification of child sexual exploitation. For the purposes of this policy, a minor is any person under the age of 18.   
  

### What is in violation of this policy? 

Any content that depicts or promotes child sexual exploitation including, but not limited to: 

* visual depictions of a child engaging in sexually explicit or sexually suggestive acts;
* illustrated, computer-generated or other forms of realistic depictions of a human child in a sexually explicit context, or engaging in sexually explicit acts; 
* sexualized commentaries about or directed at a known or unknown minor; and
* links to third-party sites that host child sexual exploitation material.  
     

The following behaviors are also not permitted:   

* sharing fantasies about or promoting engagement in child sexual exploitation;
* expressing a desire to obtain materials that feature child sexual exploitation;
* recruiting, advertising or expressing an interest in a commercial sex act involving a child, or in harboring and/or transporting a child for sexual purposes;
* sending sexually explicit media to a child;
* engaging or trying to engage a child in a sexually explicit conversation;
* trying to obtain sexually explicit media from a child or trying to engage a child in sexual activity  through blackmail or other incentives;
* identifying alleged victims of childhood sexual exploitation by name or image; and
* promoting or normalizing sexual attraction to minors as a form of identity or sexual orientation.   
     

### What is not a violation of this policy? 

* Discussions related to child sexual exploitation are permitted, provided they don’t normalise, promote or glorify child sexual exploitation **in any way**;
* Conversations about help-seeking behaviour of individuals who may struggle with an attraction to minors;
* Advocacy against illegal or harmful activity involving minors provided there is no sharing of, or linking to any material featuring child sexual exploitation; and
* Depictions of nude minors in a non-sexualized context or setting may be permitted in a limited number of scenarios (e.g., art works by internationally renowned artists that feature minors, news media reportage, media created and shared for scientific or educational purposes).  
     

### Who can report violations of this policy? 

Anyone can report potential violations of this policy, whether they have a Twitter account or not.   
 

### How can I report violations of this policy? 

If you think you've found a Twitter account distributing or promoting child sexual exploitation, [you can report it via our child sexual exploitation form](https://help.twitter.com/forms/cse). Provide the username and links to all relevant Tweets that led you to believe the account should be reviewed.   
 

### What happens if you violate this policy? 

In the majority of cases, the consequence for violating our child sexual exploitation policy is **immediate and permanent suspension**. In addition, violators will be prohibited from creating any new accounts in the future. Note: when we’re made aware of content depicting or promoting child sexual exploitation, including links to third party sites where this content can be accessed, they will be removed without further notice and reported to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC).

In a limited number of situations, where we haven’t identified any malicious intent, we will require you to remove this content. We will also temporarily lock you out of your account before you can Tweet again. Further violations will lead to your account being permanently suspended. If you believe that your account was suspended in error, you can [submit an appeal.](https://help.twitter.com/forms/general?subtopic=suspended)  
  

### Additional resources 

Learn more about our [range of enforcement options](https://help.twitter.com/rules-and-policies/enforcement-options) and our approach to [policy development and enforcement](https://help.twitter.com/rules-and-policies/enforcement-philosophy).

If you’ve found content elsewhere on the internet that is distributing or promoting child sexual exploitation, you should [file a report with NCMEC](http://www.missingkids.org/gethelpnow/cybertipline), or with your local law enforcement. If you believe the content is hosted on a website outside of the United States, you can report it on the [International Association of Internet Hotlines website](https://www.inhope.org/EN#hotlineReferral).

We partner with multiple organisations whose work is dedicated to fighting child sexual exploitation around the world. Please see the full list of [our child protection partners](https://about.twitter.com/safety/safety-partners.html#child-protection-partners).

Glorification of violence policy
================================

### Overview 

**March 2019**

**You may not threaten violence against an individual or a group of people. We also prohibit the glorification of violence.**

Glorifying violent acts could inspire others to take part in similar acts of violence. Additionally, glorifying violent events where people were targeted on the basis of their protected characteristics (including: race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease) could incite or lead to further violence motivated by hatred and intolerance. For these reasons, we have a policy against content that glorifies acts of violence in a way that may inspire others to replicate those violent acts and cause real offline harm, or events where members of a protected group were the primary targets or victims.  
  

### What is in violation of this policy?  

Under this policy, you can’t glorify, celebrate, praise or condone violent crimes, violent events where people were targeted because of their membership in a protected group, or the perpetrators of such acts. We define glorification to include praising, celebrating, or condoning statements, such as “I’m glad this happened”, “This person is my hero”, “I wish more people did things like this”, or “I hope this inspires others to act”. 

Violations of this policy include, but are not limited to, glorifying, praising, condoning, or celebrating:

* violent acts committed by civilians that resulted in death or serious physical injury, e.g., murders, mass shootings;
* attacks carried out by terrorist organizations or violent extremist groups (as defined by [our terrorism and violent extremism policy](https://help.twitter.com/rules-and-policies/violent-groups)); and
* violent events that targeted protected groups, e.g., the Holocaust, Rwandan genocide.   
     

### What is not a violation of this policy? 

Our focus is on preventing the glorification of violence that could inspire others to replicate violent acts, as well as violent events where protected groups were the primary targets or victims. Exceptions may be made for violent acts by state actors, where violence was not primarily targeting protected groups.   
 

### Who can report violations of this policy? 

Anyone can report potential violations of this policy, whether they have a Twitter account or not.   
 

### How can I report violations of this policy?

The first time you violate this policy, we will require you to remove this content. We will also temporarily lock you out of your account before you can Tweet again. If you continue to violate this policy after receiving a warning, your account will be permanently suspended.

Violent organizations policy
============================

### Overview

**  
October 2020**

There is no place on Twitter for violent organizations, including terrorist organizations, violent extremist groups, or individuals who affiliate with and promote their illicit activities. The violence that these groups engage in and/or promote jeopardizes the physical safety and well-being of those targeted. Our assessments under this policy are informed by national and international terrorism designations, as well as our violent extremist group and violent organizations criteria.  
 

**You may not threaten or promote terrorism or violent extremism.** 

Violent extremist groups are those that meet all of the below criteria:  

* identify through their stated purpose, publications, or actions as an extremist group;
* have engaged in, or currently engage in, violence and/or the promotion of violence as a means to further their cause; and
* target civilians in their acts and/or promotion of violence.

Platform manipulation and spam policy
=====================================

### Overview

**  
April 2022**

**You may not use Twitter’s services in a manner intended to artificially amplify or suppress information or engage in behavior that manipulates or disrupts people’s experience on Twitter.**

We want Twitter to be a place where people can make human connections, find reliable information, and express themselves freely and safely. To make that possible, we do not allow spam or other types of platform manipulation. We define platform manipulation as using Twitter to engage in bulk, aggressive, or deceptive activity that misleads others and/or disrupts their experience.  

Platform manipulation can take many forms and our rules are intended to address a wide range of prohibited behavior, including:  

* commercially-motivated spam, that typically aims to drive traffic or attention from a conversation on Twitter to accounts, websites, products, services, or initiatives;
* inauthentic engagements, that attempt to make accounts or content appear more popular or active than they are;
* coordinated activity, that attempts to artificially influence conversations through the use of multiple accounts, fake accounts, automation and/or scripting; and
* coordinated harmful activity that encourages or promotes behavior which violates the [Twitter Rules](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-rules.html).  
     

### What is in violation of this policy?

  
Under this policy we prohibit a range of behaviors in the following areas:  
 

### Multiple accounts and coordination

**You can’t mass-register Twitter accounts or use automation to create Twitter accounts.**

**You can’t artificially amplify or disrupt conversations through the use of multiple accounts or by coordinating with others to violate the Twitter Rules.** This includes:  

* overlapping accounts – operating multiple accounts with overlapping use cases, such as identical or similar personas or substantially similar content;
* mutually interacting accounts – operating multiple accounts that interact with one another in order to inflate or manipulate the prominence of specific Tweets or accounts; and
* coordination – creating multiple accounts to post duplicative content or create fake engagement, including:
    * posting identical or substantially similar Tweets or hashtags from multiple accounts you operate; 
    * engaging (Retweets, Likes, mentions, Twitter Poll votes) repeatedly with the same Tweets or accounts from multiple accounts that you operate;
    * coordinating with or compensating others to engage in artificial engagement or amplification, even if the people involved use only one account; and
    * coordinating with others to engage in or promote violations of the Twitter Rules, including violations of our [abusive behavior policy](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/abusive-behavior.html).  
         

### Engagement and metrics  

**  
You can’t artificially inflate your own or others’ followers or engagement.** This includes:

* selling/purchasing Tweet or account metric inflation – selling or purchasing followers or engagements (Retweets, Likes, mentions, Twitter Poll votes);
* apps – using or promoting third-party services or apps that claim to add followers or add engagements to Tweets;
* reciprocal inflation – trading or coordinating to exchange follows or Tweet engagements (including but not limited to participation in “follow trains,” “decks,” and “Retweet for Retweet” behavior); and
* account transfers or sales – selling, purchasing, trading, or offering the sale, purchase, or trade of Twitter accounts, usernames, or temporary access to Twitter accounts.  
     

### Misuse of Twitter product features  

**  
You can’t misuse Twitter product features to disrupt others’ experience.** This includes:  
 

**Tweets and Direct Messages**  

* sending bulk, aggressive, high-volume unsolicited replies, mentions, or Direct Messages;
* posting and deleting the same content repeatedly;
* repeatedly posting identical or nearly identical Tweets, or repeatedly sending identical Direct Messages;
* repeatedly posting Tweets or sending Direct Messages consisting of links shared without commentary, so that this comprises the bulk of your Tweet/Direct Message activity; and
* Tweeting an existing phrase or content in a duplicative manner, whether individually or in concert with other accounts. Learn more in our [copypasta and duplicate content policy](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/copypasta-duplicate-content.html).

**Following**  

* “follow churn” – following and then unfollowing large numbers of accounts in an effort to inflate one’s own follower count;
* indiscriminate following – following and/or unfollowing a large number of unrelated accounts in a short time period, particularly by automated means; and
* duplicating another account’s followers, particularly using automation.  
     

**Engagement**  

* aggressively or automatically engaging with Tweets to drive traffic or attention to accounts, websites, products, services, or initiatives.
* aggressively adding users to Lists or Moments.  
     

**Hashtags**   

* using a trending or popular hashtag with an intent to subvert or manipulate a conversation or to drive traffic or attention to accounts, websites, products, services, or initiatives; and
* Tweeting with excessive, unrelated hashtags in a single Tweet or across multiple Tweets.  
     

**URLs**  

* publishing or linking to malicious content intended to damage or disrupt another person’s browser (malware) or computer or to compromise a person’s privacy (phishing); and 
* posting misleading or deceptive links; e.g., affiliate links and clickjacking links.  
     

### What is not a violation of this policy?

  
The following are not in violation of this policy:

* posting links without commentary occasionally;
* coordinating with others to express ideas, viewpoints, support, or opposition towards a cause, provided such behavior does not result in violations of the Twitter Rules; and
* operating multiple accounts with distinct identities, purposes, or use cases. These accounts may interact with one another, provided they don’t violate other rules. Some examples include:
    * organizations with related but separate chapters or branches, such as a business with multiple locations;
    * operating a personal account in addition to pseudonymous accounts or accounts associated with your hobbies or initiatives; and
    * hobby/artistic bots.

### What happens if you violate this policy?

  
The consequences for violating this policy depend on the severity of the violation as well as any previous history of violations. Our action is also informed by the type of spammy activity that we have identified. The actions we take may include the following:  
 

**Anti-spam challenges**  

When we detect suspicious levels of activity, accounts may be locked and prompted to provide additional information (e.g., a phone number) or to solve a reCAPTCHA.   
 

**Denylisting URLs**

We denylist or provide warnings about URLs we believe to be unsafe. Read more about [unsafe links](https://help.twitter.com/en/safety-and-security/phishing-spam-and-malware-links.html), including how to appeal if we’ve falsely identified your URL as unsafe.  
 

**Tweet deletion and temporary account locks**  

* If the platform manipulation or spam offense is an isolated incident or first offense, we may take a number of actions ranging from requiring deletion of one of more Tweets to temporarily locking account(s). Any subsequent platform manipulation offenses will result in permanent suspension.
* In the case of a violation centering around the use of multiple accounts, you may be asked to choose one account to keep. The remaining accounts will be permanently suspended.

**Permanent suspension**

For severe violations, accounts will be permanently suspended at first detection. Examples of severe violations include:

* operating accounts where the majority of behavior is in violation of the policies described above;
* using any of the tactics described on this page to undermine the integrity of elections;
* buying/selling accounts;
* creating accounts to replace or mimic a suspended account; and
* operating accounts that Twitter is able to reliably attribute to entities known to violate the [Twitter Rules](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-rules.html).

Illegal or certain regulated goods or services
==============================================

### Overview 

**April 2019**

**You may not use our service for any unlawful purpose or in furtherance of illegal activities. This includes selling, buying, or facilitating transactions in illegal goods or services, as well as certain types of regulated goods or services.**  

Twitter takes the safety of our users seriously. In an effort to address the potential for real-world harm, we do not allow the use of Twitter for any unlawful behavior or to further illegal activities. This includes selling, buying, or facilitating transactions in illegal goods or services, as well as certain types of regulated goods or services. In some cases, we may ask you to contact a law enforcement agency and have them contact us via our law enforcement request page to ensure we have enough context to enforce this policy. In addition to reports received, we proactively surface activity that may violate this policy for human review. 

Goods or services covered under this policy include, but are not limited to:

* counterfeit goods and services\*;
* drugs and controlled substances;
* human trafficking;
* products made from endangered or protected species;
* sexual services;
* stolen goods; and
* weapons, including firearms, ammunition, and explosives, and instructions on making weapons (e.g. bombs, 3D printed guns, etc.)  
     

\*Learn more about our [counterfeit](https://help.twitter.com/rules-and-policies/counterfeit-goods-policy) policy.  
  

### What happens if you violate this policy? 

The consequences for violating this policy depends on the severity of the violation and the account’s previous history of violations.

If you violate this policy more than once and/or if your account is dedicated to the sale of illegal or regulated goods and/or services, your account may be suspended permanently.

Accounts that appear to be using misleading account information in order to engage in spamming, abusive, or disruptive behavior to promote the sale of illegal and regulated goods and/or services may be subject to suspension under our [platform manipulation and spam](https://help.twitter.com/rules-and-policies/platform-manipulation) policy. 

If you believe that your account was suspended in error, you can [submit an appeal](https://help.twitter.com/forms/general?subtopic=suspended).  
 

### Additional resources

Abusive behavior
================

[Twitter Rules](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-rules.html): You may not engage in the targeted harassment of someone, or incite other people to do so. We consider abusive behavior an attempt to harass, intimidate, or silence someone else’s voice.  
 

### Rationale

  
On Twitter, you should feel safe expressing your unique point of view. We believe in freedom of expression and open dialogue, but that means little as an underlying philosophy if voices are silenced because people are afraid to speak up. 

In order to facilitate healthy dialogue on the platform, and empower individuals to express diverse opinions and beliefs, we prohibit behavior that harasses or intimidates, or is otherwise intended to shame or degrade others. In addition to posing risks to people’s safety, abusive behavior may also lead to physical and emotional hardship for those affected.   

Learn more about our approach to [policy development and our enforcement philosophy](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/enforcement-philosophy.html).  
  

### When this applies 

  
Some Tweets may seem to be abusive when viewed in isolation, but may not be when viewed in the context of a larger conversation. When we review this type of content, it may not be clear whether it is intended to harass an individual, or if it is part of a consensual conversation. To help our teams understand the context of a conversation, we may need to hear directly from the person being targeted, to ensure that we have the information needed prior to taking any enforcement action.

We will review and take action against reports of accounts targeting an individual or group of people with any of the following behavior within Tweets or Direct Messages. For accounts engaging in abusive behavior on their profile, please refer to our [abusive profile policy](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/abusive-profile.html). For behavior targeting people based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease, this may be in violation of our [hateful conduct policy](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/hateful-conduct-policy.html).

**  
Violent threats**

We prohibit content that makes violent threats against an identifiable target. Violent threats are declarative statements of intent to inflict injuries that would result in serious and lasting bodily harm, where an individual could die or be significantly injured, e.g., “I will kill you.”

**Note**: We have a zero tolerance policy against violent threats. Those deemed to be sharing violent threats will face immediate and permanent suspension of their account.   

**Wishing, hoping, or calling for serious harm on a person or group of people**

We do not tolerate content that wishes, hopes, promotes, incites, or expresses a desire for death, serious bodily harm or serious disease against an individual or group of people. This includes, but is not limited to: 

* Hoping that someone dies as a result of a serious disease e.g., “I hope you get cancer and die.”
* Wishing for someone to fall victim to a serious accident e.g., “I wish that you would get run over by a car next time you run your mouth.”
* Saying that a group of individuals deserves serious physical injury e.g., “If this group of protesters don’t shut up, they deserve to be shot.”  
     

**About wishes of harm exceptions on Twitter** 

We recognize that conversations regarding certain individuals credibly accused of severe violence may prompt outrage and associated wishes of harm. In these limited cases, we will request the user to delete the Tweet without any risk of account penalty, strike, or suspension. Examples are, but not limited to:

*  “I wish all rapists to die.” 
* “Child abusers should be hanged.”  
     

**Unwanted sexual advances  
**

While some [consensual nudity and adult content is permitted](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/media-policy.html) on Twitter, we prohibit unwanted sexual advances and content that sexually objectifies an individual without their consent. This includes, but is not limited to:

* sending someone unsolicited and/or unwanted adult media, including images, videos, and GIFs; 
* unwanted sexual discussion of someone’s body; 
* solicitation of sexual acts; and 
* any other content that otherwise sexualizes an individual without their consent.   
     

**Using insults, profanity, or slurs with the purpose of harassing or intimidating others  
**

We take action against the use of insults, profanity, or slurs to target others. In some cases, such as (but not limited to) severe, repetitive usage of insults or slurs where the primary intent is to harass or intimidate others, we may require Tweet removal. In other cases, such as (but not limited to) moderate, isolated usage of insults and profanity where the primary intent is to harass or intimidate others, we may limit Tweet visibility as further described below. Please also note that while some individuals may find certain terms to be offensive, we will not take action against every instance where insulting terms are used. 

**  
Encouraging or calling for others to harass an individual or group of people  
**

We prohibit behavior that encourages others to harass or target specific individuals or groups with abusive behavior. This includes, but is not limited to; calls to target people with abuse or harassment online and behavior that urges offline action such as physical harassment. 

**Denying mass casualty events took place**  

We prohibit content that denies that mass murder or other mass casualty events took place, where we can verify that the event occured, and when the content is shared with abusive intent. This may include references to such an event as a “hoax” or claims that victims or survivors are fake or “actors.” It includes, but is not limited to, events like the Holocaust, school shootings, terrorist attacks, and natural disasters.

**Do I need to be the target of this content for it to be reviewed for violating the Twitter Rules?  
**

No, we review both first-person and bystander reports of such content.

**  
Consequences  
**

When determining the penalty for violating this policy, we consider a number of factors including, but not limited to, the severity of the violation and an individual’s previous record of rule violations. The following is a list of potential enforcement options for content that violates this policy:

* Downranking Tweets in replies, except when the user follows the Tweet author.
* Making Tweets ineligible for amplification in Top search results and/or on timelines for users who don’t follow the Tweet author.
* Excluding Tweets and/or accounts in email or in-product recommendations. 
* Requiring Tweet removal.
    * For example, we may ask someone to remove the violating content and serve a period of time in read-only mode before they can Tweet again. Subsequent violations will lead to longer read-only periods and may eventually result in permanent suspension.
* Suspending accounts whose primary use we’ve determined is to engage in abusive behavior as defined in this policy, or who have shared violent threats.

Learn more about [our range of enforcement options](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/enforcement-options.html).

If someone believes their account was suspended in error, they can [submit an appeal](https://help.twitter.com/forms/general?subtopic=suspended).

Platform manipulation and spam policy
=====================================

### Overview

**  
April 2022**

**You may not use Twitter’s services in a manner intended to artificially amplify or suppress information or engage in behavior that manipulates or disrupts people’s experience on Twitter.**

We want Twitter to be a place where people can make human connections, find reliable information, and express themselves freely and safely. To make that possible, we do not allow spam or other types of platform manipulation.

* coordinated activity, that attempts to artificially influence conversations through the use of multiple accounts, fake accounts, automation and/or scripting; and

### Overview 

**April 2022**

**You may not publish or post other people's private information without their express authorization and permission. We also prohibit threatening to expose private information or incentivizing others to do so.**

**In addition, you may not share private media, such as images or videos of private individuals, without their consent. However, we recognise that there are instances where users may share images or videos of private individuals, who are not public figures, as part of a newsworthy event or to further public discourse on issues or events of public interest. In such cases, we may allow the media to remain on the platform.** 

**Sharing someone’s private information:**

Sharing someone’s private information online without their permission, sometimes called doxxing, is a breach of their privacy and of the [Twitter Rules](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-rules.html). Sharing private information can pose serious safety and security risks for those affected and can lead to physical, emotional, and financial hardship.  

When reviewing reports under this policy, we consider a number of things, including:  
  

**What type of information is being shared?  
**  
We take this into consideration because certain types of private information carry higher risks than others, if they’re shared without permission. Our primary aim is to protect individuals from potential physical harm as a result of their information being shared, so we consider information such as physical location and phone numbers to be a higher risk than other types of information.   

**Who is sharing the information?**  
  
We also consider who is sharing the reported information and whether or not they have the consent of the person it belongs to. We do this because we know that there are times when people may want some forms of their personal information to be shared publicly. For example, sharing a personal phone number or email for professional networking or to coordinate social events or publicly sharing someone’s home addresses to seek help after a natural disaster.   
 

**Is the information available elsewhere online?  
**  
If the reported information was shared somewhere else before it was shared on Twitter, e.g., someone sharing their personal phone number on their own publicly accessible website, we may not treat this information as private, as the owner has made it publicly available. Note: we may take action against home addresses being shared, even if they are publicly available, due to the potential for physical harm.   
 

**Why is the information being shared?  
**  
We also factor in the intent of the person sharing the information. For example, if we believe that someone is sharing information with an abusive intent, or to harass or encourage others to harass another person, we will take action. On the other hand, if someone is sharing information in an effort to help someone involved in a crisis situation like in the aftermath of a violent event, we may not take action. 

**  
Sharing private media:**

Posting images is an important part of our users' experience on Twitter. Where individuals have a reasonable expectation of privacy in an individual piece of media, we believe they should be able to determine whether or not it is shared. Sharing such media could potentially violate users' privacy and may lead to emotional or physical harm. When we are notified by individuals depicted, or their authorized representative, that they did not consent to having media shared, we will remove the media. This policy is not applicable to public figures. 

### What is in violation of this policy? 

Under this policy, you can’t share the following types of private information, without the permission of the person who it belongs to:

* home address or physical location information, including street addresses, GPS coordinates or other identifying information related to locations that are considered private;
* identity documents, including government-issued IDs and social security or other national identity numbers – note: we may make limited exceptions in regions where this information is not considered to be private;
* contact information, including non-public personal phone numbers or email addresses; 
* financial account information, including bank account and credit card details;
* other private information, including biometric data or medical records;
* media of private individuals without the permission of the person(s) depicted; and
* media depicting prisoners of war posted by government or state-affiliated media accounts on or after April 5, 2022. 

The following behaviors are also not permitted:   

* threatening to publicly expose someone’s private information;
* sharing information that would enable individuals to hack or gain access to someone’s private information without their consent,e.g., sharing sign-in credentials for online banking services;
* asking for or offering a bounty or financial reward in exchange for posting someone’s private information;
* asking for a bounty or financial reward in exchange for not posting someone’s private information, sometimes referred to as blackmail.  
     

### What is not a violation of this policy? 

The following are not in violation of this policy:

* people sharing their own private information;
* sharing information that is publicly available elsewhere, in a non-abusive manner; and
* sharing information that we don’t consider to be private, including:
    * name;
    * birthdate or age;
    * place of education or employment;
    * location information related to commercial property or places of business, where this information is publicly available;
    * descriptions of physical appearance;
    * gossip, rumours, accusations, and allegations; and
    * screenshots of text messages or messages from other platforms (unless they contain private information e.g., phone number).  
         

**For media, the following are not in violation of our policy:**

* the media is publicly available or is being covered by mainstream media;
* the media and the accompanying tweet text add value to the public discourse or are shared in public interest;
* contains eyewitness accounts or on the ground reports from developing events; 
* the subject of the media is a public figure. 

### Who can report violations of this policy? 

**Sharing private information:**

Anyone can report private information that has been shared in a clearly abusive way (whether they have a Twitter account or not). In cases where the information hasn’t been shared with a clearly abusive intent, we need to hear directly from the owner of this information (or an authorized representative, such as a lawyer) before taking enforcement action. 

  
**Sharing private media:** 

When reporting private media, we need a first person report in order to make the determination that the image or video has been shared without their permission. We accept reports from: 

1. Individuals depicted in the reported media or
2. Their authorized representative such as:  
        a.  parents/legal guardians,  
        b.  lawyers, or  
        c.  legal representative.

### What happens if you violate this policy? 

  
When determining the penalty for violating this policy, we consider a number of factors including, but not limited to, the severity of the violation and an individual’s previous record of rule violations. 

**Sharing private information:**

* The first time you violate this policy by sharing private information (such as home address, identity documents etc.), we will require you to remove this content. We will also temporarily lock you out of your account before you can Tweet again. If you violate this policy by posting private information again after your first warning, your account will be permanently suspended.
